Highly flexible, but very costly direct transportation is often offered as a complement to standard fixed route public transport service. In the integrated dial-a-ride problem (IDARP), these modes of transport are combined and certain legs of the passengers journeys may be performed with the fixed route public transport system. We extend the IDARP and include timetables for the fixed route services, forcing the fleet of vehicles to schedule the arrival at transfer locations with care. Two mixed integer linear programming formulations of the integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetables are presented and analyzed. The key modeling challenge is that of the transfers between the fleet of vehicles and the fixed route public transport system. The formulations differ in how the transfers are modeled and the differences are thoroughly discussed. The computational study compares the formulations in terms of network size, computational time and memory usage and conclusions about their performances are drawn.;01.07.17;14.08.25 17:23;14.08.25 17:23;14.08.25 17:23;217-241;;1;9;;Public Transp;;;;;;;;en;;;;;Springer Link;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/3KDV354L/Posada et al. - 2017 - The integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetabled fixed route service.pdf;;;"Cost effectiveness; Dial-a-ride; Mobility; Multimodal transport; Operational planning; Optimization; Paratransit; Public transport";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditional public transportation has shown its limitations to satisfy the changes in growing cities and particularly unable to adapt to particular events or particular people such as transportation of unable or elderly people that concerns significantly user's transportation. Moreover, the door-to-door transportation is sometimes too expensive. For that, this paper considers the Integrated Dial-A-Ride Problem (IDARP) which is a special case of the Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP). It deals with the scheduling of vehicles to insure the transportation of the passengers, with the integration of the fixed route service to the DARP. We have proposed a new formulation for the Integrated Dial-A-Ride Problem with timetabled fixed route service (IDARP-TT) with the objective of minimizing the combined operational costs and the waiting time.;2019-06;16.08.25 10:21;16.08.25 10:21;16.08.25 10:21;01.

This problem is to schedule dial-a-ride requests, where some part of each journey may be carried out by a fixed route service. The IDARP is a generalization of the Dial-a-Ride Problem. An arc-based formulation is proposed, and it is shown how the model can be made easier to solve by arc elimination, variable substitution and the introduction of subtour elimination constraints. Small instances of the IDARP can be solved using an exact solution method, and one such instance is studied. We also describe how input and output data can be created and visualized in a geographic information system.;01.05.09;17.08.25 11:47;17.08.25 11:47;17.08.25 11:47;39-54;;1;1;;Public Transp;;;;;;;;en;;;;;Springer Link;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/SWUWN64Z/Häll et al. - 2009 - The Integrated Dial-a-Ride Problem.pdf;;;"Elimination Rule; Tabu Search; Transfer Location; Travel Time; Variable Substitution";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It implies some modeling and practical issues. Practical wise, it only integrates a single fixed line. It also does not accept any dial-a-ride problem (DARP) request. From the modeling perspective, the transfer node system enlarges quickly with each new request. It also requires more strengthening strategies to be adopted. The proposed integrated dial-a-ride problem fixed-route selection (IDARP-FRS) handles some of these issues. It extends the IDARP to include iterations over a two-line fixed service. An additional set of constraints is devised to easily switch the proposed model to the IDARP and even accommodate users from the dial-a-ride problem. The IDARP-FRS also introduces a set of newly constructed direction-based constraints, for controlling the service quality. Besides, the symmetry-breaking constraints are brought from the literature to the context of the IDARP-FRS to further strengthen the model. The computational tests are implemented on Gurobi and showed the significant role of the proposed constraints in reducing the problem complexity.;07.03.21;19.08.25 10:34;19.08.25 10:34;19.08.25 10:34;;;;;;;The Integrated Dial-A-Ride-Problem;;;;;IEOM Society International;Singapore, Singapore;en;;;;;DOI.org (Crossref);;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/RDB2HP7W/Hassan et al. - 2021 - The Integrated Dial-A-Ride-Problem Fixed Route Selection.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this work, a model for the Dial-a-Ride problem with public transport integration is presented. The model aims to minimise the sum of waiting times for all passengers, focusing on suburban stations with realistic route data. The model is optimally solvable for small instances, but a heuristic approach based on simulated annealing is proposed for larger instances. The research results suggest that the model is well suited to address the problem discussed and the heuristic approach provides reliable results in a reasonable computational time and is therefore suitable for practical applications.;2025;19.08.25 10:35;19.08.25 10:35;;573-580;;;;;;;;;;;Springer Nature Switzerland;Cham;en;;;;;Springer Link;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/QTAHNJAT/Saathoff - 2025 - Practice-Oriented Solution Methods for the Integrated Dial-a-Ride Problem.pdf;;;"Integrated Dial-a-Ride problem; Public transport integration; Simulated annealing; Sustainable urban transport";"Voigt, Guido; Fliedner, Malte; Haase, Knut; Brüggemann, Wolfgang; Hoberg, Kai; Meissner, Joern";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Governments and companies offer such services, and due to the flexibility and service level required by the users, it is considerably more costly than public transportation, besides emitting higher levels of CO$$_2$$. Hence, it is crucial to analyze alternatives to improve operational costs and efficiency without compromising the quality of the service. This paper introduces a variant for the dial-a-ride problem with private fleets and common carriers (DARP-PFCC) integrated with public transportation. Requests can be served by the private fleet, the common carrier, or by integrating them into the public transportation system. In this case, users are collected at the pickup locations and taken to bus stops. After the bus trip, other vehicles serve them from the bus stops to their final destination. Bus schedules must be considered when deciding on the best integration trip. As a methodology, we solve this extension of the DARP-PFCC with a metaheuristic and machine learning hybrid method by combining a biased random key genetic algorithm with the Q-Learning and local search heuristics (BRKGA-QL). This paper also introduces some improvements to this method, particularly with respect to population quality and diversity, thanks to a new mutation method in the classical crossover operator and deterministic rules for the learning process. Computational experiments on a new benchmark data set with realistic data from Québec City show that our BRKGA-QL outperforms its previous version. In addition, we provide a qualitative analysis for the DARP-PFCC, showing that the middle mile integration with public transportation can save up to 20% in operating costs, besides reducing the traveled distances of private vehicles and common carriers.;01.08.25;19.08.25 10:35;19.08.25 10:35;19.08.25 10:35;809-847;;1;351;;Ann Oper Res;;;;;;;;en;;;;;Springer Link;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/G8ZT6BPI/Schenekemberg et al. - 2025 - Hybrid metaheuristic for the dial-a-ride problem with private fleet and common carrier integrated wi.pdf;;;"Bus; Common carrier; Dial-a-ride; Genetic algorithm; Inter-modal mobility";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
