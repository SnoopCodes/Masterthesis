We are motivated by a problem that arises in maritime transportation where delays are frequent and should be taken into account. Our model only allows routes that are feasible for all values of the travel times in a predetermined uncertainty polytope, which yields a robust optimization problem. We propose two new formulations for the robust problem, each based on a different robust approach. The ﬁrst formulation extends the well-known resource inequalities formulation by employing adjustable robust optimization. We propose two techniques, which, using the structure of the problem, allow to reduce signiﬁcantly the number of extreme points of the uncertainty polytope. The second formulation generalizes a path inequalities formulation to the uncertain context. The uncertainty appears implicitly in this formulation, so that we develop a new cutting plane technique for robust combinatorial optimization problems with complicated constraints. In particular, efﬁcient separation procedures are discussed. We compare the two formulations on a test bed composed of maritime transportation instances. These results show that the solution times are similar for both formulations while being signiﬁcantly faster than the solutions times of a layered formulation recently proposed for the problem. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban waste collection is one of the municipal activities with large costs and has many practical difficulties. In other words, waste collection and disposal is a costly task due to high operating expenses (fuel, maintenance, recycling, manpower, etc.) and small improvements in this field can result in tremendous savings on municipal expenditure. In the raised problem, the goal is to minimize total cost including traversing cost, vehicle employment cost, and exit penalty from permissible time windows. In this problem, the waste is deposited at the points indicating the demand nodes, in which each demand shows the volume of generated waste. Considering multiple trips for vehicles and time windows are the most critical features of the problem, so that the priorities of serving some specific places such as hospitals can be observed. Since vehicle routing problems (VRP) belongs to NP-hard problems, an efficient simulated annealing (SA) is proposed to solve the problem. The computational results show that our proposed algorithm has a great performance in a short computational time in comparison with the CPLEX solver. Finally, in order to demonstrate the applicability of the model, a case study is analyzed in Iran, and the optimal policies are presented.;01.01.19;19.08.25 16:16;19.08.25 16:16;19.08.25 16:16;Apr 13;;1_suppl;37;;Waste Manag Res;Developing an applied algorithm for multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time windows in urban waste collection;;;;;;;EN;;;;;SAGE Journals;;Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd STM;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/KTW22YMR/Babaee Tirkolaee et al. - 2019 - Developing an applied algorithm for multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time windows in urban wa.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The formulations are tailored to meet the specific demands of the vending machine industry in Medellín, Colombia, and require considering a PVRP with time windows, a heterogeneous fleet, and multiple depots. This scenario, tailored to address real-world complexity and computational challenges, brings to light an exponential surge in integer variables as customer numbers increase. The research presents an analysis of PVRPs that include the four mentioned attributes, compares their similarities, and delves into their nuances. From the analysis it is derived that the variant of the PVRP presented has not been considered previously, taking into account not only these attributes, but also the restrictions involved. Empirical experiments are conducted to examine the intricate interplay between the two proposed formulations, highlighting their impact on the performance of the GUROBI solver. The study provides valuable insights into problem-specific adaptations and algorithmic approaches, emphasizing the significance of the proposed formulations in addressing multifaceted PVRPs. In essence, this research positions the introduction of these two formulations as a pioneering step, offering a new paradigm for approaching the PVRP.;03.10.24;19.08.25 16:16;19.08.25 16:16;19.08.25 16:16;e0311303;;10;19;;PLOS ONE;;;;;;;;en;;;;;PLoS Journals;;Publisher: Public Library of Science;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/Y539T9QS/Arenas-Vasco et al. - 2024 - Effect of formulations over a Periodic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with multiple depots, het.pdf;;;"Colombia; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Linear programming; Operations research; Taxonomy; Transportation; Urban areas";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
