We call this problem the on-demand bus routing problem (ODBRP). Given are a fleet of buses with fixed capacity, a set of bus stations and travel times between them, and a set of transportation requests. Each transportation request consists of a set of potential departure and a set of potential arrival bus stations, as well as a time window, that is, an earliest departure time and a latest arrival time. The aim of the ODBRP is to (1) assign each passenger to a departure and arrival bus station and (2) develop a set of bus routes to fulfill each request in time while minimizing the total travel time of all users. We present the static version of the ODBRP, as well as a straightforward large neighborhood search heuristic to solve it. The performance of the heuristic is established by comparing it to an off-the-shelve heuristic solver (LocalSolver). We also use our heuristic to solve (slightly modified instances of) the well-known dial-a-ride problem. The results found by the heuristic for the on-demand bus system are compared to those of a simulated traditional public bus system with fixed lines and timetables. A thorough analysis of the comparison demonstrates that total user ride times can be significantly lower in an on-demand public bus system and shows that an on-demand bus system works best with a large number of small buses.;2022;22.07.25 09:11;22.07.25 09:11;22.07.25 09:11;1417-1453;;3;29;;;The static on-demand bus routing problem;;;;;;;en;© 2021 The Authors.

This is a new problem setting of significant practical relevance because several ride-sharing providers launched in recent years in large European cities. In contrast to the standard dial-a-ride problem, these providers focus on the general public. Therefore, they are amongst others in competition with taxis and private cars, which makes a more customer-oriented objective necessary. We present an adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) as well as a dynamic programming algorithm (DP), which are tested in comprehensive computational studies. Although the DP can only be used for a single tour and, due to the computational effort, as a restricted version or for small instances, the ALNS also works efficiently for larger instances. The results indicate that ride-sharing proposals may help to solve the trade-off between individual transport, profitability of the provider, and reduction of traffic and pollution.;01.03.22;16.08.25 13:52;16.08.25 13:52;16.08.25 13:52;87-119;;1;44;;OR Spectrum;;;;;;;;en;;;;;Springer Link;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/DT6JAFGX/Pfeiffer und Schulz - 2022 - An ALNS algorithm for the static dial-a-ride problem with ride and waiting time minimization.pdf;;;"Adaptive large neighbourhood search; Demand responsive transport; Dial-a-ride; Dynamic programming";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A static DARP model is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem. To validate the model, several random small network problems are solved by using the commercial optimization package CPLEX. Three heuristic algorithms based on sequential insertion, parallel insertion, and clustering first-routing second are proposed to solve this problem within a reasonable time for implementation in a real-world situation. The results of the three heuristic methods are compared with the results obtained from exact solution by CPLEX to validate and evaluate the three heuristic algorithms. Computational results show that the three heuristic algorithms are superior to the exact algorithm in relation to the calculation time as the problem size (in number of demands) increases. Of the three heuristic algorithms, the one based on sequential insertion is more efficient than the other heuristic algorithms based on parallel insertion and clustering first-routing second.;01.01.11;19.08.25 10:41;19.08.25 10:41;19.08.25 10:41;68-77;;1;2218;;;;;;;;;;EN;;;;;SAGE Journals;;Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/37FDQFLN/Kim und Haghani - 2011 - Model and Algorithm considering Time-Varying Travel Times to Solve Static Multidepot Dial-a-Ride Pro.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The ultimate aim is to offer an alternative to displacement optimized individually and collectively. Indeed the DRP is a multi-criteria problem, the proposed solution of which aims to reduce both route duration in response to a certain quality of service provided.

Its main objective is to minimize the number of vehicles used to satisfy all the demand, subject to service quality constraints. Passenger deviation from desired time is minimized in the scheduling stage after the insertion position is determined. This method improves the basic parallel insertion heuristic in two aspects. First, a rejected-reinsertion operation is performed each time it is infeasible to insert a new request into the vehicle routes. Each assigned request close to the new request in time frame and geographic location is tentatively removed from its current vehicle and the new request is inserted into the best position in that vehicle route, followed by the reinsertion of the removed request elsewhere in the system. Of all available rejected-reinsertions, the least-cost one is then implemented. Second, an improvement procedure including trip reinsertion and trip exchange operations is implemented periodically. Two sets of problems are tested in a computational study. These show that the proposed heuristic achieves vehicle reductions of up to 17% over the parallel insertion heuristic and is very eﬃcient computationally.;2007-08;19.08.25 10:42;19.08.25 10:42;19.08.25 10:42;736-755;;7;41;;Transportation Research Part B: Methodological;;;;;;;;en;https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/;;;;DOI.org (Crossref);;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/HUVK643F/Luo und Schonfeld - 2007 - A rejected-reinsertion heuristic for the static Dial-A-Ride Problem.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this heuristic, a properly organized local search strategy and a diversiﬁcation strategy are used to improve initial solutions. Then the improved solutions can be reﬁned further by an intensiﬁcation strategy. The performance of this heuristic was evaluated by intensive computational tests on some randomly generated instances. Small gaps to the lower bounds from the column generation method were obtained in very short time for instances with no more than 200 requests. Although the result is not sensitive to the initial solution, the computational time can be greatly reduced if some eﬀort is spent to construct a good initial solution. With this good initial solution, larger instances up to 2000 requests were solved in less than 10 hours on a popular personal computer.;2006-10;19.08.25 10:42;19.08.25 10:42;19.08.25 10:42;1117-1139;;2;174;;European Journal of Operational Research;;;;;;;;en;https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/;;;;DOI.org (Crossref);;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/VDKE7YAT/Xiang et al. - 2006 - A fast heuristic for solving a large-scale static dial-a-ride problem under complex constraints.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
