Highly flexible, but very costly direct transportation is often offered as a complement to standard fixed route public transport service. In the integrated dial-a-ride problem (IDARP), these modes of transport are combined and certain legs of the passengers journeys may be performed with the fixed route public transport system. We extend the IDARP and include timetables for the fixed route services, forcing the fleet of vehicles to schedule the arrival at transfer locations with care. Two mixed integer linear programming formulations of the integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetables are presented and analyzed. The key modeling challenge is that of the transfers between the fleet of vehicles and the fixed route public transport system. The formulations differ in how the transfers are modeled and the differences are thoroughly discussed. The computational study compares the formulations in terms of network size, computational time and memory usage and conclusions about their performances are drawn. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;"Cost effectiveness; Dial-a-ride; Mobility; Multimodal transport; Operational planning; Optimization; Paratransit; Public transport";"Carrier mobility; Cost effectiveness; Fleet operations; Integer programming; Mass transportation; Optimization; Scheduling; Transportation; Dial-a-Ride; Multimodal transport; Operational planning; Paratransit; Public transport; Transportation routes";Article;Final;All Open Access;Scopus;2-s2.0-85021244920

A reduction to the shortest path problem enables finding an optimal solution for FRDARP in polynomial time. However, the basic graph construction ends up with a huge graph, which makes the reduction impractical due to its memory consumption. To this end, we propose several pruning heuristics that enable us to considerably reduce the size of the graph through its dynamic construction. Additionally, we utilize the special features of the problem to apply parallelization to the graph traversal process. Our experiments show that each of the proposed heuristics on its own improves the practical solvability of FRDARP. Moreover, using them together is considerably more efficient than any single heuristic. Finally, the experiments confirm the efficiency of our suggested parallelization policy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;"DARP; Fixed route; Graph representation; Parallelization; Pruning heuristics; Timetabling in transport";"Graph theory; % reductions; DARP; Dial-a-ride problem; Fixed route; Graph representation; Parallelizations; Pruning heuristic; Shortest path problem; Timetabling; Timetabling in transport; Polynomial approximation";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85140655513

We propose a transportation system combining the spatial aspects of a fixed sequence of bus stops with the temporal flexibility of ridepooling. In the line-based Dial-a-Ride problem (liDARP), vehicles adhere to a fixed, ordered sequence of stops in their routes, with the possibility of taking shortcuts and turning if they are empty. We propose three MILP formulations for the liDARP with a multi-objective function balancing environmental aspects with customer satisfaction, comparing them on a real-world bus line. Our experiments show that the formulation based on an Event-Based graph is the fastest, solving instances with up to 50 requests in under one second. Compared to the classical DARP, the liDARP is computationally faster, with minimal increases in total distance driven and average ride times. © Kendra Reiter, Marie Schmidt, and Michael Stiglmayr.;"DARP; liDARP; on-demand; public transport; ridepooling";"Balancing; Bus transportation; Buses; Mass transportation; Transportation routes; Bus services; DARP; Dial-a-ride problem; Flexible service; Line-based dial-a-ride problem; On demands; Public transport; Ridepooling; Spatial aspect; Transportation system; Customer satisfaction";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85207053633

The line-based Dial-a-Ride Problem (liDARP) is a variant where the passengers are transported along a fixed sequence of stops, with the option of taking shortcuts. In this paper we consider the liDARP with the objective function to maximize the number of transported requests. We investigate the complexity of two optimization problems: the liDARP, and the problem to determine the minimum number of turns needed in an optimal liDARP solution, called the MinTurn problem. Based on a number of instance parameters and characteristics, we are able to state the boundary between polynomially solvable and NP-hard instances for both problems. Furthermore, we provide parameterized algorithms that are able to solve both the liDARP and MinTurn problem. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.;"Dial-a-Ride Problem; liDARP; NP-hardness; Parameterized Complexity";"Fleet operations; Dial-a-ride problem; Fixed sequence; Line-based dial-a-ride problem; NP-hardness; Objective functions; Optimal lines; Optimization problems; Parameterized complexity; Passenger transportation; NP-hard";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-86000462010

It implies some modeling and practical issues. Practical wise, it only integrates a single fixed line. It also does not accept any dial-a-ride problem (DARP) request. From the modeling perspective, the transfer node system enlarges quickly with each new request. It also requires more strengthening strategies to be adopted. The proposed integrated dial-a-ride problem fixed-route selection (IDARP-FRS) handles some of these issues. It extends the IDARP to include iterations over a two-line fixed service. An additional set of constraints is devised to easily switch the proposed model to the IDARP and even accommodate users from the dial-a-ride problem. The IDARP-FRS also introduces a set of newly constructed direction-based constraints, for controlling the service quality. Besides, the symmetry-breaking constraints are brought from the literature to the context of the IDARP-FRS to further strengthen the model. The computational tests are implemented on Gurobi and showed the significant role of the proposed constraints in reducing the problem complexity. © IEOM Society International.;"And Vehicle-routing problem; Bimodal transportation; DARP; Dial-a-ride problem; Public transportation";;Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85114221518

Traditional public transportation has shown its limitations to satisfy the changes in growing cities and particularly unable to adapt to particular events or particular people such as transportation of unable or elderly people that concerns significantly user's transportation. Moreover, the door-to-door transportation is sometimes too expensive. For that, this paper considers the Integrated Dial-A-Ride Problem (IDARP) which is a special case of the Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP). It deals with the scheduling of vehicles to insure the transportation of the passengers, with the integration of the fixed route service to the DARP. We have proposed a new formulation for the Integrated Dial-A-Ride Problem with timetabled fixed route service (IDARP-TT) with the objective of minimizing the combined operational costs and the waiting time. © 2019 IEEE.;"Integrated Dial-A-Ride Problem with timetabled fixed route service; satisfaction of the passengers; transportation of disabled persons; waiting time";"Disabled persons; Supply chain management; Dial-a-ride problem; Elderly people; Public transportation; satisfaction of the passengers; Transport services; Waiting-time; Transportation routes";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85075984996
