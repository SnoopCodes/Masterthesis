We investigate the potential beneﬁts of such a system, as well as the ride-matching technology required to support it, by means of an extensive computational study. Our study shows that the integration of a ride-sharing system and a public transit system can signiﬁcantly enhance mobility and increase the use of public transport.;2018-02;14.08.25 12:17;14.08.25 12:17;14.08.25 12:17;Dez 21;;;90;;Computers & Operations Research;Enhancing urban mobility;;;;;;;en;;;;;DOI.org (Crossref);;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/8MRV9HZC/Stiglic et al. - 2018 - Enhancing urban mobility Integrating ride-sharing and public transit.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, in reality, the large majority of users request individual rides (and not pooled rides) in existing on-demand services, leading to increases in motorised vehicle miles travelled. In this study, we investigate to what extent fare discounts, additional travel time, and the (un)willingness to share the ride with (different numbers of) other passengers play a role in the decision of individuals to share rides. To this end, we design a stated preference study targeting Dutch urban individuals. In our research, we (1) disentangle the sharing aspect from related time–cost trade-offs (e.g. detours), (2) investigate preference heterogeneity regarding the studied attributes and identify distinct market segments, and (3) simulate scenarios to understand the impact of the obtained parameters in the breakdown between individual and pooled services. We find that less than one third of respondents have strong preferences against sharing their rides. Also, we find that different market segments vary not only in their values of the willingness to share, but also in how they perceive this willingness to share (per-ride or proportional to the in-vehicle time). Further, the scenario analysis demonstrates that the share of individuals who are willing to share rides depends primarily on the time–cost trade-offs, rather than on the disutility stemming from pooling rides per se.;01.08.21;14.08.25 14:08;14.08.25 14:08;14.08.25 14:08;1733-1765;;4;48;;Transportation;;;;;;;;en;;;;;Springer Link;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/PUXRGGR3/Alonso-González et al. - 2021 - What are the determinants of the willingness to share rides in pooled on-demand services.pdf;;;"Ridesharing; Choice modelling; Stated preference; DRT; Scenario analysis; Willingness to share";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yet, it is unknown how urban travelers value different attributes of the ridepooling’s operational concept. Which characteristics of ridepooling concepts are most important to the users? In order to obtain a deeper understanding of travelers’ preferences concerning a ridepooling system, choice-based Conjoint Analysis was performed. Based on a literature review and a focus group, six relevant attributes of the operational concept of ridepooling systems were determined: fare, walking distance, time of booking, shift of departure time, travel time, and information provision. Data from 237 German city dwellers were analyzed with the help of Cox regression. Except for time of booking, all service attributes significantly affected the respondents’ choice. Besides the high relevance of fare, the results underline the particular importance of the attribute walking distance to the pick-up point for elderly. The results give guidance for the creation of user-centered public transport systems that meet the requirements of the prospective passengers and thus might contribute to the development of shared passenger transport systems for sustainable urban mobility.;2018-10;14.08.25 14:10;14.08.25 14:10;14.08.25 14:10;3711;;10;10;;;;;;;;;;en;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/;;;;www.mdpi.com;;Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/UDIL55J3/König et al. - 2018 - Analyzing Urban Residents’ Appraisal of Ridepooling Service Attributes with Conjoint Analysis.pdf;;;"shared mobility; choice modelling; Conjoint Analysis; passenger transport; ridepooling";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A survey with over 4,000 (non-)users was conducted and a discrete choice model was estimated to understand users’ preferences to use the service. The study provides insights into the sociodemographic characteristics of ridepooling users, their preferences towards the service and first findings on the preferences towards an intermodal combination with public transportation. The results show that factors such as travel cost, time, trip distance and purpose are significant in influencing the use of ridepooling services. According to the choice experiment, intermodal travel is a viable choice for trip distances above 10 km, primarily for public transport subscription holders. The findings of this study can inform the design and marketing of future ridepooling services, and contribute to the broader debate on the potential benefits and challenges of shared mobility services in improving urban mobility and reducing the negative impacts of transportation on the environment.;2023-09;14.08.25 14:11;14.08.25 14:11;14.08.25 14:11;8:00 PM;;;;;;;;;;;;;en;;;;;DOI.org (Datacite);;Artwork Size: 8 p.

Nevertheless, to apply this kind of service successfully efficient algorithms have to be implemented for effective fleet management to exploit the benefits associated with this mobility service. Especially real time computation of finding beneficial assignments is a problem not solved for large problem sizes until today. In this study, we show the importance of using advanced algorithms by comparing a fast, but simple insertion heuristic algorithm with a state-of-the-art multi-step matching algorithm. We test the algorithms in various scenarios based on private vehicle trip OD-data for Munich, Germany. Results indicate that in the tested scenarios by using the multi-step algorithm up to 8$\%$ additional requests could be served while also 10$\%$ additional driven distance could be saved. However, computational time for finding optimal assignments in the advanced algorithm exceeds real time rather fast as problem size increases. Therefore, several aspects to reduce the computational time by decreasing redundant checks of the advanced multi step algorithm are introduced. Finally, a refined vehicle selection heuristic based on three rules is presented to furthermore reduce the computational effort. In the tested scenarios this heuristic can speed up the most cost intensive algorithm step by a factor of over 8, while keeping the number of served requests almost constant and maintaining around 70$\%$ of the driven distance saved in the system. Considering all algorithm steps, an overall speed up of 2.5 could be achieved.;29.07.20;14.08.25 14:23;14.08.25 14:23;14.08.25 14:23;;;;;;;;;;;;arXiv;;;;;;;arXiv.org;;arXiv:2007.14877 [eess];;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/SZALS7XS/Engelhardt et al. - 2020 - Speed-up Heuristic for an On-Demand Ride-Pooling Algorithm.pdf;;;"Computer Science - Systems and Control; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control; Mathematics - Optimization and Control";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;arXiv:2007.14877;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
