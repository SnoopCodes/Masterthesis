Then, shared mobility is the short-term access to shared vehicles according to the user’s needs and convenience. The contributions and added value of this paper are to provide an up-to-date and well-structured review on the area of shared mobility to researchers and practitioners of the transport sector. Hence, this paper presents a bibliographical review of shared mobility and its diverse modalities, as an alternative to individual transportation, especially in cases of individual automobiles or short trips restricted to an urban city. The present literature review on shared modes of transportation has discovered that the introduction of these modes alone will not solve transportation problems in large cities, with elevated and growing motorization rates. However, it can among the strategies employed to help alleviate the problems caused by traffic jams and pollution by reducing the number of vehicles in circulation, congestions, and the urban emission of polluting gases. Thus, the implementation of shared mobility schemes offers the potential to enhance the efficiency, competitiveness, social equity, and quality of life in cities. This paper covers the fundamental aspects of vehicle and/or ride sharing in urban centers, and provides an overview of current shared mobility systems.;2018-12;14.08.25 12:15;14.08.25 12:15;14.08.25 12:15;4342;;12;10;;;;;;;;;;en;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/;;;;www.mdpi.com;;Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/REFTN9NQ/Machado et al. - 2018 - An Overview of Shared Mobility.pdf;;;"shared mobility; bikesharing; carsharing; on-demand ride services; personal vehicle sharing; ridesharing";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Large-scale ride-sharing requires mathematical models and algorithms that can match large groups of riders to a fleet of shared vehicles in real time, a task not fully addressed by current solutions. We present a highly scalable anytime optimal algorithm and experimentally validate its performance using New York City taxi data and a shared vehicle fleet with passenger capacities of up to ten. Our results show that 2,000 vehicles (15% of the taxi fleet) of capacity 10 or 3,000 of capacity 4 can serve 98% of the demand within a mean waiting time of 2.8 min and mean trip delay of 3.5 min.           ,                             Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (               i               ) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (               ii               ) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with ∼3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.;17.01.17;14.08.25 12:35;14.08.25 12:35;14.08.25 12:35;462-467;;3;114;;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Early actors include Google and Europe’s CityMobil2, who seek pilot deployments in low-speed settings. This work investigates SAVs’ potential for U.S. urban areas via multiple applications across the Austin, Texas, network. This work describes advances to existing agent- and network-based SAV simulations by enabling dynamic ride-sharing (DRS, which pools multiple travelers with similar origins, destinations and departure times in the same vehicle), optimizing fleet sizing, and anticipating profitability for operators in settings with no speed limitations on the vehicles and at adoption levels below 10 % of all personal trip-making in the region. Results suggest that DRS reduces average service times (wait times plus in-vehicle travel times) and travel costs for SAV users, even after accounting for extra passenger pick-ups, drop-offs and non-direct routings. While the base-case scenario (serving 56,324 person-trips per day, on average) suggest that a fleet of SAVs allowing for DRS may result in vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) that exceed person-trip miles demanded (due to anticipatory relocations of empty vehicles, between trip calls), it is possible to reduce overall VMT as trip-making intensity (SAV membership) rises and/or DRS users become more flexible in their trip timing and routing. Indeed, DRS appears critical to avoiding new congestion problems, since VMT may increase by over 8 % without any ride-sharing. Finally, these simulation results suggest that a private fleet operator paying $70,000 per new SAV could earn a 19 % annual (long-term) return on investment while offering SAV services at $1.00 per mile for a non-shared trip (which is less than a third of Austin’s average taxi cab fare).;01.01.18;14.08.25 12:37;14.08.25 12:37;14.08.25 12:37;143-158;;1;45;;Transportation;;;;;;;;en;;;;;Springer Link;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/23KWS9WU/Fagnant und Kockelman - 2018 - Dynamic ride-sharing and fleet sizing for a system of shared autonomous vehicles in Austin, Texas.pdf;;;"Connected and autonomous vehicles; Dynamic ride-sharing; MATSim simulation; Shared autonomous vehicles";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We develop optimization-based approaches that aim at minimizing the total system-wide vehicle miles incurred by system users, and their individual travel costs. To assess the merits of our methods we present a simulation study based on 2008 travel demand data from metropolitan Atlanta. The simulation results indicate that the use of sophisticated optimization methods instead of simple greedy matching rules substantially improve the performance of ride-sharing systems. Furthermore, even with relatively low participation rates, it appears that sustainable populations of dynamic ride-sharing participants may be possible even in relatively sprawling urban areas with many employment centers.;2011-11;14.08.25 12:59;14.08.25 12:59;14.08.25 12:59;1450-1464;;9;45;;Transportation Research Part B: Methodological;Dynamic ride-sharing;;;;;;;en;https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/;;;;DOI.org (Crossref);;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/8UNENEET/Agatz et al. - 2011 - Dynamic ride-sharing A simulation study in metro Atlanta.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, a shortage of taxicabs has always been critical in many urban contexts especially during peak hours, and taxi has great potential to maximize its efficiency by employing the shared-ride concept. There are recent successes in dynamic ride-sharing projects that are expected to bring substantial benefits arising from energy consumption and operation efficiency and thus, it is essential to develop advanced shared-taxi-dispatch algorithms and investigate the collective benefits of dynamic ride-sharing by maximizing occupancy and minimizing travel times in real-time. This article investigates how taxi services can be improved by proposing shared-taxi algorithms and what type of objective functions and constraints could be employed to prevent excessive passenger detours. Hybrid-simulated annealing (HSA) is applied to dynamically assign passenger requests efficiently. A series of simulations are conducted with two different taxi operation strategies. The simulation results reveal that allowing ride-sharing for taxicabs increases productivity over the various demand levels and HSA can be considered as a suitable solution to maximize the system efficiency of dynamic ride-sharing.;2016;14.08.25 13:01;14.08.25 13:01;14.08.25 13:01;275-291;;4;31;;;;;;;;;;en;© 2015 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering;;;;Wiley Online Library;;_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mice.12157;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/GLP69C56/Jung et al. - 2016 - Dynamic Shared-Taxi Dispatch Algorithm with Hybrid-Simulated Annealing.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of the conceivable mobility services based on driverless cars is shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). This service could merge cabs, carsharing, and ridesharing systems into a singular transportation mode. However, the success and competitiveness of future SAV services depend on their operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration and fleet specification. In addition, any change in operational models will result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of SAV simulation in a multimodal dynamic demand system with integrated SAV user taste variation, this study evaluates the performance of various SAV fleets and vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. Also, the impact of ridesharing and rebalancing strategies on service performance is investigated. Research results suggest that the performance of SAV is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing scheme proposed in this study (i.e., 20% lower for ridesharing scenario), the standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all scenarios. The results also underline that enabling vehicle-rebalancing strategies may have an important effect on both user and servicerelated metrics. The estimated SAV average and maximum driven distance prove the importance of vehicle range and charging station deployment.;2019-10;14.08.25 13:38;14.08.25 13:38;14.08.25 13:38;15-33;;;107;;Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies;;;;;;;;en;;;;;DOI.org (Crossref);;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/EXTGC48B/Vosooghi et al. - 2019 - Shared autonomous vehicle simulation and service design.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These algorithms have primarily focused on optimally producing vehicle schedules to pick up and drop off requests. The redistribution of idle vehicles to areas of high demand, known as rebalancing, on the contrary has received little attention in the context of ride-sharing. In this paper, we present a method to rebalance idle vehicles in a ride-sharing enabled MoD fleet. This method consists of an algorithm to optimally partition the fleet operating area into rebalancing regions, an algorithm to determine a real-time demand estimate for every region using incoming requests, and an algorithm to optimize the assignment of idle vehicles to these rebalancing regions using an integer linear program. Evaluation with historical taxi data from Manhattan shows that we can service 99.8% of taxi requests in Manhattan using 3000 vehicles with an average waiting time of 57.4 seconds and an average in-car delay of 13.7 seconds. Moreover, we can achieve a higher service rate using 2000 vehicles than prior work achieved with 3000. Furthermore, with a fleet of 3000 vehicles, we reduce the average travel delay by 86%, the average waiting time by 37%, and the amount of ignored requests by 95% compared to earlier work at the expense of an increased distance travelled by the fleet.;2018-10;14.08.25 13:53;14.08.25 13:53;14.08.25 13:53;4539-4546;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;IEEE Xplore;;ISSN: 2153-0866;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/FW3QBJKA/Wallar et al. - 2018 - Vehicle Rebalancing for Mobility-on-Demand Systems with Ride-Sharing.pdf;;;"Public transportation; Schedules; Automobiles; Real-time systems; Delays; Partitioning algorithms";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, in reality, the large majority of users request individual rides (and not pooled rides) in existing on-demand services, leading to increases in motorised vehicle miles travelled. In this study, we investigate to what extent fare discounts, additional travel time, and the (un)willingness to share the ride with (different numbers of) other passengers play a role in the decision of individuals to share rides. To this end, we design a stated preference study targeting Dutch urban individuals. In our research, we (1) disentangle the sharing aspect from related time–cost trade-offs (e.g. detours), (2) investigate preference heterogeneity regarding the studied attributes and identify distinct market segments, and (3) simulate scenarios to understand the impact of the obtained parameters in the breakdown between individual and pooled services. We find that less than one third of respondents have strong preferences against sharing their rides. Also, we find that different market segments vary not only in their values of the willingness to share, but also in how they perceive this willingness to share (per-ride or proportional to the in-vehicle time). Further, the scenario analysis demonstrates that the share of individuals who are willing to share rides depends primarily on the time–cost trade-offs, rather than on the disutility stemming from pooling rides per se.;01.08.21;14.08.25 14:08;14.08.25 14:08;14.08.25 14:08;1733-1765;;4;48;;Transportation;;;;;;;;en;;;;;Springer Link;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/PUXRGGR3/Alonso-González et al. - 2021 - What are the determinants of the willingness to share rides in pooled on-demand services.pdf;;;"Ridesharing; Choice modelling; Stated preference; DRT; Scenario analysis; Willingness to share";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In order to obtain a deeper understanding of travelers’ preferences concerning a ridepooling system, choice-based Conjoint Analysis was performed. Based on a literature review and a focus group, six relevant attributes of the operational concept of ridepooling systems were determined: fare, walking distance, time of booking, shift of departure time, travel time, and information provision. Data from 237 German city dwellers were analyzed with the help of Cox regression. Except for time of booking, all service attributes significantly affected the respondents’ choice. Besides the high relevance of fare, the results underline the particular importance of the attribute walking distance to the pick-up point for elderly. The results give guidance for the creation of user-centered public transport systems that meet the requirements of the prospective passengers and thus might contribute to the development of shared passenger transport systems for sustainable urban mobility.;2018-10;14.08.25 14:10;14.08.25 14:10;14.08.25 14:10;3711;;10;10;;;;;;;;;;en;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/;;;;www.mdpi.com;;Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/UDIL55J3/König et al. - 2018 - Analyzing Urban Residents’ Appraisal of Ridepooling Service Attributes with Conjoint Analysis.pdf;;;"shared mobility; choice modelling; Conjoint Analysis; passenger transport; ridepooling";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It builds on what's known as on-demand ride-pooling, which dynamically assigns customer trips to fleet vehicles in real time, sharing their rides, and thus aiming to save on driving distances and fleet size compared to on-demand ride-hailing services. In the case of RPP, a additional parcel demand is introduced that is less sensitive to longer travel and waiting times and is less negatively affected by changing vehicles. In this case, parcels are served with a lower priority than passengers and simply ride along with appropriate passenger trips. This makes it possible to achieve a more efficient use of vehicle capacity and further reduce the total distance traveled for passenger and logistics mobility. This research is divided into a conceptual and scenario definition part to define the proposed service and develop possible operational scenarios, a theoretical simulation-based approach to quantify the potential of the proposed RPP service, and a practical field test to investigate its real-world applicability. Agent-based RPP simulations show that the integration of logistics services into a ride-pooling service is possible and can exploit unused system capacity without degrading passenger service. Depending on the assignment strategies, parcels can be served up to a parcel-to-passenger demand ratio of 1:10, while total fleet kilometers can be reduced compared to the status quo, as the additional mileage for logistics service can be fully integrated. In the base scenario of the simulation, approximately 50,000 passengers and 5,000 parcels are transported by a fleet of 600 cars or 1,200 rickshaws. The RPP field test included a mobile phone web app and five bicycle rickshaws offering the RPP service in the Maxvorstadt district in Munich, Germany. Each rickshaw had two passenger seats and additional space for parcels. The service was available daily between 11:00 and 19:00 for one week and was completely free for users. The field test showed that the RPP service is ready to operate today and provided interesting insights into the real-world operational parameters for such a service.;01.10.23;14.08.25 14:20;14.08.25 14:20;;;;;;;;Ride-Parcel-Pooling;;;;;;;;;;;;ResearchGate;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/YQPL6YTF/Fehn et al. - 2023 - Ride-Parcel-Pooling Integrating On-Demand Passenger Transportation and City Logistics.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

AMoD provides a service similar to taxi or ride-sharing services, while being driverless. It is expected to attract a huge fraction of travelers currently using mass transit or private vehicles and will have a disruptive effect on urban transportation. While most studies have focused on the operational efficiency of the technology itself, our work aims to investigate its impact on urban mobility. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we present a flexible AMoD modeling and simulation framework developed within a multi-modal agent-based urban simulation platform (SimMobility). The framework allows the detailed simulation and assessment of different AMoD operations together with an activity-based framework that accounts for changes in demand, such as activity participation, trip making, mode, destination, or route choice decisions. Second, we focus our attention on the role of mass transit in a futuristic urban system where AMoD is widely available. Mass transit is already challenged by current ride-sharing services, for example, Uber and Lyft, which provide comparatively better and cheaper services. This trend will plausibly be exacerbated with the introduction of AMoD, which may indirectly act as a replacement to mass transit. Our simulation results show that mass transit is irreplaceable, despite the high efficiency of AMoD, in order to avoid congestion and maintain a sustainable urban transportation system with acceptable levels of service.;2018-12;14.08.25 14:26;14.08.25 14:26;14.08.25 14:26;608-618;;8;2672;;Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board;Automated Mobility-on-Demand vs. Mass Transit;;;;;;;en;;;;;DOI.org (Crossref);;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/QUY6HV5N/Basu et al. - 2018 - Automated Mobility-on-Demand vs. Mass Transit A Multi-Modal Activity-Driven Agent-Based Simulation.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In future, fleets of shared and pooled autonomous vehicles may transform urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce an approach to dynamically simulate these services within a full-stack transport simulation using an insertion-based algorithm. In a first test case, using a taxi data set from Berlin, the potential for shared rides is evaluated using a fleet of vehicles with a capacity between two and four ride requests. The simulation suggests that the overall vehicle kilometers traveled may be reduced by 15–20%, while travel time increases can be kept at a relatively low level of less than three minutes per person. Additionally, the simulation results suggest in which areas of the city it may be the most rewarding to offer shared services.;2017-10;14.08.25 14:29;14.08.25 14:29;14.08.25 14:29;275-280;;;;;;City-wide shared taxis;;;;;;;;;;;;IEEE Xplore;;ISSN: 2153-0017;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/7NLT3HYR/Bischoff et al. - 2017 - City-wide shared taxis A simulation study in Berlin.pdf;;;"Vehicle dynamics; Heuristic algorithms; Public transportation; Urban areas; Automobiles; Conferences";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This shared automated mobility system is expected to provide a seamless door-to-door service for urban travellers, much like what the existing transportation network companies (TNC) do, but with decreased labour cost and more flexible relocation operations due to the vehicles’ automation. We propose an integer non-linear programming (INLP) model that optimizes the routing of the ATs to maximize the system profit, depending on dynamic travel times, which are a non-linear function of the ATs’ flows. It is important to involve traffic congestion in such a routing problem since for a growing number of ATs circulating in the city their number will lead to delays. The model is embedded within a rolling horizon framework, which divides a typical day into several horizons to deal with the real-time travel demand. In each horizon, the routing model is solved with the demand at that interval and assuring the continuity of the trips between horizons. Nevertheless, each horizon model is hard to solve given its number of constraints and decision variables. Therefore, we propose a solution approach based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, which allows identifying a near-optimal solution for this difficult problem. Numerical experiments for the city of Delft, The Netherlands, are used to demonstrate the solution quality of the proposed algorithm as well as obtaining insights about the AT system performance. Results show that the solution algorithm can solve the proposed model for hard instances. Ride-sharing makes the AT system more capable to provide better service regarding delay time and the number of requests that can be attended by the system. The delay penalty on the profit objective function is an effective control parameter on guaranteeing the service quality while maintaining system profitability.;2020-03;14.08.25 14:34;14.08.25 14:34;14.08.25 14:34;260-281;;;112;;Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies;;;;;;;;en;;;;;DOI.org (Crossref);;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/E6DNYHAC/Liang et al. - 2020 - Automated taxis’ dial-a-ride problem with ride-sharing considering congestion-based dynamic travel t.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The sharing economy has already transformed ridesharing, bicycle-sharing, and electric scooters, with shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) poised to reshape car ownership. This study pursues two objectives: firstly, to establish a market segmentation for shared ride services and secondly, to evaluate the environmental impact of ridesharing in different contexts. To mitigate potential biases linked to stated preference data, we analysed the navette service, utilized by a research institute in Europe, closely resembling future SAVs. The market segmentation relied on hierarchical cluster analysis using employee survey responses, while the environmental analysis was grounded in the 2019 navette service data. Our analysis revealed four unique employee clusters: Cluster 1, emphasizing active transportation and environmental awareness; Cluster 2, showing openness towards SAVs given reliable alternatives are available; Cluster 3, the largest segment, highlighting a demand for policy support and superior service quality; and Cluster 4, which places a premium on time, suggesting a potential need for strategies to make the service more efficient and, consequently, discourage private car use. These findings highlight a general willingness to adopt shared transport modes, signalling a promising transition to shared vehicle ownership with significant environmental benefits achievable through service design and policy measures. © 2024 by the authors.";2024;14.08.25 15:11;14.08.25 15:11;;1199-1220;;3;7;;Smart.
