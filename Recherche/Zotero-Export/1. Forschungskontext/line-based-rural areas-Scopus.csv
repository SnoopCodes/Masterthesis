We analysed countrywide space-time accessibility to primary health services by private car and multimodal walk-ride-walk travel chains of public transport in Finland. The analysis utilises register-based population grid cell data at 250m × 250 m resolution, road network with scheduled public transport data and geocoded locations of four types of primary health service. Our results show that the Finnish population reaches primary health services well, also by public transport, which is most beneficial in urban fringes, where health services are not immediately available. However, accessibility of services may be limited for some segments of the population, such as carless households located in remote areas, and teenagers who access health services independently. Distinct regional differences exist in accessibility, particularly in rural areas. The continuous pressure to reduce the number of service facilities may further deter service accessibility of these segments of the population. As this kind of transport disadvantage may create or reinforce social disadvantage and exclusion, as well as health inequalities, ensuring an equal access to primary health services is important.","2021-11","2025-08-05 08:44:09","2025-08-05 08:44:09","2025-08-05 08:44:09","102583","","","136","","","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/D3VSG9J3/Kotavaara et al. - 2021 - Geographical accessibility to primary health care in Finland – Grid-based multimodal assessment.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a slack arrival strategy to reduce the number of rejected passengers and idle time at checkpoints resulting from uncertain travel demand. This strategy relaxes the departure time constraints of the checkpoints that do not function as transfer stations. A system cost function that includes the vehicle operation cost and customer cost is deﬁned to measure system performance. Theoretical and simulation models are constructed to test the beneﬁts of implementing the slack arrival strategy in ﬂex-route transit under expected and unexpected demand levels. Experiments over a real-life ﬂex-route transit service show that the proposed slack arrival strategy could improve the system performance by up to 40% with no additional operating cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can help transit operators provide more cost-eﬃcient ﬂex-route transit services in suburban and rural areas.","2018-07","2025-08-05 08:50:46","2025-08-05 08:50:46","2025-08-05 08:50:46","442-455","","","92","","","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/QNN7SJJF/Zheng et al. - 2018 - A slack arrival strategy to promote flex-route transit services.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this review is to raise awareness and stress the knowledge gap on the importance of transport innovations for this age group, particularly in regards to needs and innovative requisites (i.e., vehicle, transport infrastructure and organisational makeup). A scoping literature search identified 106 publications as relevant literature from the more than 2500 reviewed publications. Transport need for the elderly is discussed by way of accessibility, affordability, availability and acceptability. Vehicle innovation examines pedestrian data, vehicle design (i.e., private cars and vehicles in public transport), fixed route services, paratransit vehicles and slow mode alternatives such as cycling, motorised mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs. Transport infrastructure innovation takes into account technical infrastructural adjustments, related recommendations and guidelines and specific solutions for peri-urban and rural areas. Organisational innovation investigates governmental support mechanisms, legislation, financial limitations, education and social-based training and internet as well as relating information and communication technology-based findings. Vast majority of the research is centric to developed countries.

This paper identiﬁes a new category of transit policies, called demi-ﬂexible operating policies, to ﬁll the gap between ﬂexible transit services and conventional ﬁxed-route systems. The passenger cost function is deﬁned as the performance measure of transit systems and the analytic work is performed based on a real-world ﬂag-stop transit service, in which we compare its system performance with another two comparable systems, the ﬁxed-route and ﬂex-route services, at expected and unexpected demand levels in order to be closer to reality. In addition, the dynamic-station policy is introduced to assist the ﬂex-route service to better deal with unexpectedly high demand. Experiments demonstrate the unique advantages of demi-ﬂexible operating policies in providing affordable, efﬁcient, and reliable transport service in low-demand operating environments and this work is helpful to optimize the unifying framework for designing public transit in suburban and rural areas.","2015-10","2025-08-05 09:01:28","2025-08-05 09:01:28","2025-08-05 09:01:28","215-230","","","80","","","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/G2JH8G5Z/Qiu et al. - 2015 - Demi-flexible operating policies to promote the performance of public transit in low-demand areas.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regular public road transportation traditionally uses ﬁxed routes and schedules, which can be extremely expensive in rural areas and certain periods of the day in urban areas due to low and unpredictable demand. Demand Responsive Transportation systems are a kind of hybrid transportation approach between a taxi and a bus that try to address these problems with routes and frequencies that may vary according to the actual observed demand. Demand Responsive Transportation seems to have potential to answer the sustainability and social inclusion challenges in a context of austerity. However, DRT projects may fail: it is not only important to solve the underlying model in an efﬁcient way, but also to understand how different ways of operating the service affect customers and operators. To help design DRT services, we developed an innovative approach integrating simulation and optimization. Using this simulator, we compared a real night-time bus service in the city of Porto, Portugal, with a hypothetical ﬂexible DRT service for the same scenario.","2015-09","2025-08-05 09:27:30","2025-08-05 09:27:30","2025-08-05 09:27:30","94-103","","","51","","","Sustainable Demand Responsive Transportation systems in a context of austerity","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/8XIFZK32/Gomes et al. - 2015 - Sustainable Demand Responsive Transportation systems in a context of austerity The case of a Portug.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We applied for the ﬁrst time the Potential Mobility Index (PMI) developed by Martens (2016) to analyze the equity implications of the alternatives. We applied it in a new and unique way with two measures of travel time: in-vehicle travel time and door to door travel time.

To enhance urban mobility, much research was invested in traveling time prediction: given an origin and destination, provide a passenger with an accurate estimation of how long a journey lasts. In this work, we investigate a novel combination of methods from Queueing Theory and Machine Learning in the prediction process. We propose a prediction engine that, given a scheduled bus journey (route) and a ‘source/destination’ pair, provides an estimate for the traveling time, while considering both historical data and real-time streams of information that are transmitted by buses. We propose a model that uses natural segmentation of the data according to bus stops and a set of predictors, some use learning while others are learning-free, to compute traveling time. Our empirical evaluation, using bus data that comes from the bus network in the city of Dublin, demonstrates that the snapshot principle, taken from Queueing Theory, works well yet suffers from outliers. To overcome the outliers problem, we use Machine Learning techniques as a regulator that assists in identifying outliers and propose prediction based on historical data.","2017-03","2025-08-07 13:45:16","2025-08-07 13:47:31","2025-08-07 13:45:16","266-280","","","64","","Information Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/IE9BK3HE/Gal et al. - 2017 - Traveling time prediction in scheduled transportation with journey segments.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
