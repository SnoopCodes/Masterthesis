However, the market share of their pooled version (ridesharing, e.g., UberPOOL or LyftLine) is still low, despite its potential in addressing the mobility challenges that dense urban cities are facing. In this research, we analyse user preferences towards pooled on-demand services regarding their time-reliabilitycost trade-offs. We study, via stated preference experiments, the value of time (VOT) and value of reliability (VOR) of the different trip stages (waiting stage, in-vehicle stage, and transfer stage when combined with line-based public transport). We target urban Dutch individuals (N = 1006), and address commuting and leisure trips. Results show in-vehicle VOT for pooled on-demand services to amount to 7.88–10.80 €/h. These values are somewhat higher than known values of traditional public transport. We also find waiting VOT (both before the trip and during the transfer stage) to be lower than values previously reported in literature. In general, we find VOR to be lower than VOT: the reliability ratio (VOR/VOT ratio) for both the waiting stage and the in-vehicle stage being around 0.5. In order to understand different preferences, we also estimate latent class choice models. The analysis shows that the main difference between classes pertains to the overall time-cost and reliability-cost trade-offs (VOT and VOR values) rather than in different valuations of the reliability ratio. In addition to serving as input for demand forecasting models such as macroscopic static assignment and agent-based simulation models, our findings can support service providers in developing their strategy when designing pooled ondemand services.","2020-06","2025-08-05 10:39:11","2025-08-05 10:39:11","2025-08-05 10:39:11","102621","","","115","","","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","Crossref","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/R7B5ZGES/Alonso-González et al. - 2020 - Value of time and reliability for urban pooled on-demand services.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This option is called variable-type services. Conventional, flexible, and variable-type service alternatives optimized for various conditions are compared to explore when variable-type bus services might be preferable to purely conventional or flexible service. The optimization models used for purely conventional or flexible service are adapted from previous studies. These models are integrated into a new model for optimizing variable-type bus service. The results of sensitivity analyses show how demand variability over time and other factors affect the relative effectiveness of conventional, flexible, and variable-type bus services.

These services, often referred to as on-demand public transport, are aimed at meeting personal travel demands through the use of shared vehicles that run on flexible routes using advanced tools for dynamic scheduling. This paper presents an agent-based traffic simulation model that was developed to evaluate the performance of on-demand public transport and compare it with existing scheduled bus services using a case study of the inner city of Melbourne in Australia. The key performance measures used in the comparative evaluation included quality of service and passenger experience in terms of waiting times, the efficiency of service and operations in terms of hourly vehicle utilization, and system efficiency in terms of trip completion rates, passenger kilometers travelled and total passenger trip times. The results showed significant benefits for passengers who use on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services. The on-demand bus service was found to reduce average total passenger waiting times by 89% during the Morning Peak; by 78% during the Mid-Day period; by 81% during the Afternoon Peak; and by more than 95% during other periods of the day. From an operator’s perspective, the on-demand services were found to achieve around 70% vehicle utilization rates during peak hours compared to a utilization rate not exceeding 16% for the scheduled bus services. Even during off-peak periods, the occupancies for on-demand services were almost twice the vehicle occupancies for scheduled bus services. In terms of system efficiency, the on-demand services achieved a trip completion rate of 85% compared to a trip completion rate of 67% for the scheduled bus services. The total passenger-kilometers travelled was similar for both scheduled and on-demand bus services, which refutes claims that on-demand bus services induce more kilometers of travel. The trip completion times were around 55% shorter for on-demand bus services compared to scheduled services, which represents a significant saving in travel time for users. Finally, the paper presents average emissions per completed trip for both types of services and shows a significant reduction in emissions for on-demand services compared to conventional bus services. These include, on average, a 48% reduction in CO2 emissions per trip; 82% reduction in NO emissions per trip; and 41% reduction in p.m.10 emissions per trip. These findings clearly demonstrate the superior benefits of on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services.","2020-01","2025-08-05 11:10:44","2025-08-05 11:10:44","2025-08-05 11:10:44","4117","","10","12","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 10 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/8ET8F9D8/Liyanage und Dia - 2020 - An Agent-Based Simulation Approach for Evaluating the Performance of On-Demand Bus Services.pdf","","","disruptive mobility; Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD); shared mobility; smart urban mobility; sustainable public transport; agent-based modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While it has been reported that such systems improve the usability of bus systems when applied in a small town or area, it is not obvious how and under what conditions the systems are effective in comparison to traditional fixed-route bus systems. We conducted two computer simulations of dial-a-ride and fixed-route systems in order to compare the usability and profitability of both systems. Simulation results indicated that: (1) The usability of the dial-a-ride system with a fixed number of buses drops very quickly when the number of requests(demands) increases. (2) When we increase the number of buses proportionally to the number of demand, the usability of the dial-a-ride system is improved more significantly than that of the fixed-route system. (3) When frequency of demands is sufficiently, the dial-a-ride system is a reasonable solution from the both usability and profitability perspectives.","2004","2025-08-05 11:28:52","2025-08-05 11:28:52","","105-119","","","","","","Is Dial-a-Ride Bus Reasonable in Large Scale Towns?","","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/QETN6CBG/Shinoda et al. - 2004 - Is Dial-a-Ride Bus Reasonable in Large Scale Towns Evaluation of Usability of Dial-a-Ride Systems b.pdf","","","Normal Route; Route System; Single Vehicle; Transportation Research Part; Unit Period","Kurumatani, Koichi; Chen, Shu-Heng; Ohuchi, Azuma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper considers the integration of autonomous vehicles into bus transit systems and proposes a modeling framework to determine the optimal bus fleet size and its assignment onto multiple bus lines in a bus service network considering uncertain demand. The mixed-integer stochastic programming approach is applied to formulate the problem. We apply the sample average approximation (SAA) method to solve the formulated stochastic programming problem. To tackle the nonconvexity of the SAA problem, we first present a reformulation method that transforms the problem into a mixed-integer conic quadratic program (MICQP), which can be solved to its global optimal solution by using some existing solution methods. However, this MICQP based approach can only handle the small-size problems. For the cases with large problem size, we apply the approach of quadratic transform with linear alternating algorithm, which allows for efficient solution to large-scale instances with up to thousands of scenarios in a reasonable computational time. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of introducing autonomous buses as they are flexible to be assigned across different bus service lines, especially when demand uncertainty is more significant. The introduction of autonomous buses would enable further reduction of the required fleets and total cost. The model formulation and solution methods proposed in this study can be used to provide bus transit operators with operational guidance on including autonomous buses into bus services, especially on the autonomous and conventional bus fleets composition and allocation.","2021-10-01","2025-08-07 08:07:58","2025-08-07 08:07:58","2025-08-07 08:07:58","2735-2763","","5","48","","Transportation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/J46A8JGP/Tian et al. - 2021 - Autonomous and conventional bus fleet optimization for fixed-route operations considering demand unc.pdf","","","Transportation Economics; Autonomous bus service; Conic programming; Continuous Optimization; Demand uncertainty; Discrete Optimization; Operations Research and Decision Theory; Operations Research, Management Science; Quadratic transform; Stochastic programming; Transportation Technology and Traffic Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

E-bus scheduling is a critical problem in the operation planning stage of transit management to ensure efficient and reliable transit service. In Chinese mega cities, the e-bus networks are operated with many bus routes characterized by high service frequency and long operation time, making the e-bus scheduling a large-scale problem. Besides, the transit agency requires the vehicle-depot constraint to limit the e-bus reposition since it is not cost-efficient. An efficient method to generate optimized schedules that meet the above requirements is desired by the transit agencies. In this paper, we address a large-scale multi-depot electric bus scheduling problem considering the vehicle-depot constraint and partial recharging policy. A mixed integer programming model and an efficient branch-and-price (BP) algorithm are developed to solve the problem. In the BP algorithm, we devise a heuristic method to generate good initial solutions and adopted heuristic decisions in the label setting algorithm to solve the pricing problem. In this way, the efficiency of the BP algorithm is achieved and the large-sized problem instances can be solved. We conduct extensive numerical experiments based on the fixed-route and multi-route operation cases in Shenzhen. The results show that the BP algorithm can generate provable high-quality solutions. Sensitivity analysis indicates that increasing battery capacity and charging rate can reduce the operational cost. The optimal charging schedules can also provide guide in determining the capacity of the charging facilities.","2023-12","2025-08-07 08:28:41","2025-08-07 08:28:41","2025-08-07 08:28:41","15355-15368","","12","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/399WPKD3/Jiang et al. - 2023 - A Branch-and-Price Algorithm for Large-Scale Multidepot Electric Bus Scheduling.pdf","","","Batteries; branch-and-price; Costs; Electric bus; Electric vehicles; Heuristic algorithms; Numerical models; partial recharging; Public transportation; resource-constrained shortest path; Schedules; scheduling; Shortest path problem; Urban areas; Vehicle dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Structure of the model","","","","","","CONTRAM is a traffic assignment model developed by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory for use in the design of traffic management schemes in urban areas. Given the traffic demands between origins and destinations for a network it predicts routes of vehicles and flows and queues on links. It is a capacity restrained model which takes account of the interactive effects of traffic between junctions over a network and the variation through time of traffic conditions-in particular it models the build up and decay of congestion such as occurs during peak periods. An iterative procedure is used to assign vehicles to their minimum journey time routes through a network taking into account the delay at each junction along a route at the time that a vehicle reaches each junction. The assignment procedure, which uses a packet structure to represent elements of flow of vehicles for movements between Origins and Destinations, allows multi-routeing for vehicles with freedom of choice of route; fixed route vehicles, such as buses, are sent along their predefined routes, but still encounter the same delays at junctions experienced by other vehicles. The modelling in CONTRAM is consistent with the queue calculations in ARCADY, PICADY and OSCADY.","1989","2025-08-07 08:30:52","2025-08-07 08:30:52","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport & Road Research Laboratory (Great Britain), TRRL Report","","","English","","Report","","","Scopus","","Issue: 178 Journal Abbreviation: Transp Road Res Lab (GB) TRRL Rep Publication Title: Transp Road Res Lab (GB) TRRL Rep","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/4N9BC8DY/0024872990.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03721302 (ISSN)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the consideration of the geographical space, the cooperation and competition relationship between bus and metro lines is qualitatively introduced according to the geographical location and service range of metro (800 m radius) and bus (500 m radius) stations. The competition and cooperation indexes are applied to define the co-opetition relationship between bus and metro lines. The bus line optimization model is constructed based on the co-opetition coefficient and Changsha Metro Line Number 2 is chosen as a case study to verify the optimization model.

In this work, we propose a dynamic transit bus system that aims at combining the higher convenience provided to passengers in on-demand systems with the sustainability of public transport. The goal is to attract more passengers to the transit service by offering reduced walk-to-station distance and total travel time compared to the fixed lines. Our proposed system plans the routes and intermediate stops of the transit lines based on the actual observed demand. Due to the complexity of the resulting optimization problem under investigation, we propose a solution method which splits the problem into four stages: clustering, initialization, optimization, and merging. We compare our proposed system in two settings: flexible (i.e., all intermediate stations are dynamic), and semi-flexible (i.e., original fixed lines intermediate stations are kept at the route and more dynamic stations are added) to the fixed static line. Our results show that our proposed system offers a more sustainable option and can reduce the system-wide travel distance by attracting more on-demand passengers to the transit service by offering them reduced walking distance and travel duration compared to the static lines. We also quantify the positive impact of passengers’ willingness to act more sustainably by accepting to walk more or arrive later to their destinations on the system-wide sustainability.","2023-06","2025-08-07 08:38:18","2025-08-07 08:38:19","2025-08-07 08:38:18","104100","","","151","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/53BKHAKX/Abdelwahed et al. - 2023 - Balancing convenience and sustainability in public transport through dynamic transit bus networks.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The developed methodologies enable the system to continuously re-optimize and re-adjust the vehicle routing plan that achieves the primary objective of maximizing the total number of served riders and the secondary objective of minimizing the total vehicle miles or hours traveled, simultaneously accounting for mixed types of riders' mobility requirements. This paper develops a re-optimization model implemented by a rolling horizon planning approach. An efficient heuristic algorithm, namely Large Neighborhood Search by Tabu Search algorithm (LNS-TS), is developed to solve large-scale problems. To validate the methodology, a simulation is developed to model rider activity, as well as the ridesharing process. This paper presents two case studies in Houston, Texas: a first-mile ridesharing service improving transit connectivity and a post-disaster cooling shelter access service addressing emergency transport under extreme heat. These cases represent two distinct operational contexts—everyday urban mobility and emergency disaster response—demonstrating the model's adaptability across diverse scenarios. The results generated by the re-optimization methodologies are compared with those from a periodic optimization approach, where matching and routing optimizations are conducted in isolation at different time intervals. The simulation results demonstrate that the routing plan obtained by the real-time re-optimization methodologies can serve more riders and save more vehicle miles or hours traveled compared with the periodic optimization methods. The proposed real-time, dynamic re-optimization approach for ridesharing feeder services not only demonstrates practical benefits but also holds promise for applications in autonomous vehicle systems.","2025-10","2025-08-07 09:20:28","2025-08-07 09:20:28","2025-08-07 09:20:28","104329","","","128","","Journal of Transport Geography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/9HJADHXQ/Yi et al. - 2025 - Real-time re-optimization for generalized ridesharing feeder service with mixed scheduled and on-dem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modular buses are an emerging technology in which modules of relatively small capacity can be dynamically docked together to form greater capacity buses and can, therefore, make the transit system capable of adapting the capacity to the actual mobility demand. A module can be shifted from one line to another at pre-defined intersections and can be relocated when empty, if beneficial. We call these two operations sharing and rebalancing, respectively. Given a transit network comprising multiple bus lines and a mobility demand, we present an integer linear program to determine an optimal assignment of modules to lines, so that the mobility demand is met with a minimum total number of modules. Computational experiments show that, by exploiting the flexibility of modular buses, the total capacity deployed can be reduced by 49% with respect to a conventional transit system, whereas the average occupancy ratio increases from 41.22% to 72.85%.","2024","2025-08-07 09:41:17","2025-08-07 09:41:17","2025-08-07 09:41:17","","","","","","","","","","","","SSRN","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/838WCWA3/Filippi et al. - 2024 - Exploiting the Flexibility of Modular Buses in an Urban Transit System.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By integrating the cost efficiency of fixed-route transit system and the flexibility of demand responsive transit system, the proposed model is capable of letting operating feeder busses temporarily deviate from their current route so as to serve the reported demand locations. With an objective of minimizing total bus travel time, a new operational mode is then proposed to allow busses to serve passengers on both street sides. In addition, when multiple feeder busses are operating in the target service area, the proposed model can provide an optimal plan to locate the nearest one to response to the demands. A three-stage solution algorithm is also developed to yield meta-optimal solutions to the problem in a reasonable amount of time by transforming the problem into a traveling salesman problem. Numerical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model as well as the heuristic solution approach.

When the feeder service region is sufficiently large, the spatial heterogeneity in demand distribution must be considered. This paper develops continuum approximation models for optimizing a heterogeneous fixed-route feeder network in a rectangular service region next to a rail terminal. Our work enhances previous studies by: (i) optimizing heterogeneous stop spacings along with line spacings and headways; (ii) accounting for passenger boarding and alighting numbers on bus dwell times and patron transfer delays at the rail terminal; and (iii) examining the advantages of asymmetric coordination between trunk and feeder schedules in both service directions. To tackle the increased modeling complexity, we introduce a semi-analytical method that combines analytically derived properties of the optimal solution with an iterative search algorithm. Local transit agencies can readily utilize this approach to design a real fixed-route feeder system.","2024-11","2025-08-07 10:12:16","2025-08-07 10:12:16","2025-08-07 10:12:16","104214","","","189","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/ZAZJWRDB/Zhen und Gu - 2024 - Feeder bus service design under spatially heterogeneous demand.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
