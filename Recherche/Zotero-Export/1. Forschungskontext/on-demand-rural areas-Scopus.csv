An agent-based supply-side simulation is built to assess the performance of the proposed service in ﬁfty-two scenarios with diﬀerent ﬂeet sizes and ridesharing preferences.

The operation type and other decisions are jointly optimized here for a bus transit system connecting a major terminal to local regions. Conventional and ﬂexible bus sizes, conventional bus route spacings, areas of service zones for ﬂexible buses, headways, and ﬂeet sizes are jointly optimized in multi-dimensional nonlinear mixed integer optimization problems.

With the developing economic, social and environmental trends, there is pressure for alternative solutions to the policy of subsidising conventional bus services. One potential solution is to adopt more flexible routes and/or timetables to better match the required demand. Therefore such ‘on demand’ or ‘Demand Responsive Transport’ (DRT) services (known as paratransit in the US) have been adopted in a number of locations. This paper seeks to explore the effects of area-wide factors on the demand of DRT by reporting the results of a statistical analysis of DRT service provision in the metropolitan region of Greater Manchester, the public transport authority of which offers one of the largest and most diverse range of DRT schemes in the UK. Specifically, this paper employs a multilevel modelling approach to investigate the impact of both DRT supply-oriented factors at the service area level and socio-economic factors at the lower super output area (LSOA) level on the average number of trips made by DRT per year. This hierarchical or ‘nested’ structure was adopted because typically the LSOAs within the same Service Area may share similar characteristics. It is found that the demand for DRT services was higher in areas with low car ownership, low population density, high proportion of white people, and high levels of social deprivation, measured in terms of income, employment, education, housing and services, health and disability, and living environment.","2014-05-01","2025-08-09 08:26:53","2025-08-09 08:26:53","2025-08-09 08:26:53","589-610","","3","41","","Transportation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/HWT585PW/Wang et al. - 2014 - Multilevel modelling of Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) trips in Greater Manchester based on area-.pdf","","","Flexible public transport; Area-wide socio-economic factors; Demand Responsive Transport (DRT); Multilevel statistical modelling; Paratransit; System-wide effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, passengers continue their journey using traditional forms of public transport. On the one hand, on-demand feeder services have been a topic of discussion in a number of recent studies, since these services can serve the demand efficiently. On the other hand, traditional feeder services with predetermined routes and timetables provide predictability and easier cost control. In this paper, a demand-responsive feeder service is considered, which combines positive characteristics of both traditional services as well as on-demand-only services. This feeder service has mandatory bus stops which are always serviced, as well as optional bus stops which are only serviced when there is demand for transportation nearby. To optimize the performance of this feeder service, a large neighborhood search heuristic is developed. Experimental results on 14 benchmark instances illustrate that the LNS algorithm obtains solutions with an average gap of 1% or less compared to the optimal solution, within 1s of runtime. Larger instances can also be solved, typically in less than 60s. The results also show that the demand-responsive feeder service generally outperforms a traditional service in terms of service quality, often by more than 60%.","2021-06","2025-08-09 08:36:37","2025-08-09 08:36:37","2025-08-09 08:36:37","103102","","","127","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/JP3D5R56/Galarza Montenegro et al. - 2021 - A large neighborhood search algorithm to optimize a demand-responsive feeder service.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We set up the DRT service in such a way that its service quality (in terms of waiting time and in-vehicle time) is comparable to the replaced buses. The results show that a DRT service can be more cost efficient than regular buses and can produce significantly less CO2 emissions when the demand level is low.

The most popular fixed route bus service (FRBS) is intended to serve a large population along with fixed stops, routes, and schedules. However, in low demand conditions, bus transit operators pay a high cost per passenger to maintain the desired level of service. A demand-responsive transit (DRT) is a commonly discussed transportation solution for serving low passenger demand. Although the conventional DRT system offers a shared-ride door-to-door service to passengers, its implementation is challenging and expensive during peak hours. The present study suggests a form of transit system that combines the rigidity of FRBS and flexibility of DRT to operate in low demand routes. This defined category of transit service is referred to as semi-flexible transit (SFT) system. The proposed SFT service is delivered along the fixed bus route and a limited number of fixed stops based on a flexible schedule to meet passenger requests. The defined SFT system offers reduced operating time and higher vehicle utilization. The study considers an operation of the proposed SFT service for two types of service delivery systems: Contract-Out Taxi Service (COTS), and In-House Paratransit Service (IHPS). A methodology is proposed to develop analytical models describing operational costs of regular FRBS, COTS, and IHPS as a function of demand or annual ridership. Operating cost models are proposed as a decision support tool to enable transit planners to determine the passenger demands along the route at which it is justifiable to “switch” from FRBS to the SFT system to minimize the total cost of operation. Further, the analysis results for FRBS indicate that operating costs are strongly related to vehicle-service hours and for SFT services to average vehicle occupancy rate and deadheading time. Applications of the proposed models and analysis method are demonstrated for a low demand route in the City of Regina.","2020-03-01","2025-08-09 09:06:24","2025-08-09 09:06:24","2025-08-09 09:06:24","147-169","","1","12","","Public Transp","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/8VVUC4PW/Mehran et al. - 2020 - Analytical models for comparing operational costs of regular bus and semi-flexible transit services.pdf","","","Semi-flexible transit; Bus transit; Contract-out taxi service; Demand-responsive transit; Economic performance; Flexible transit; In-house paratransit service; Operating costs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The optimization procedure allows the cost comparison of different semi-flexible services. Transit systems operated by cars (shared taxicabs) with flexible layouts are preferable for low demand densities (less than 92 pax/km2-h). For very high demand (higher than 200 pax/km2-h), bus systems with fixed layout and variable stop locations present the lowest total cost per passenger.

Using survey data from 156 respondents from households in the EcoBus service area and utilizing linear regression analysis, this study confirms that car availability harms the intended use of DRT and that physical impairment has a positive effect, as identified several times in the literature. Furthermore, the influence of age on the intended EcoBus use depends on the residence place’s city size and hence on its offer of daily public services. While residents of a sub-centre of the region are significantly less willing to use the EcoBus with increasing age, there is an opposite tendency for small villages. Thus, in small inaccessible localities, the likelihood of using EcoBus increases with age, suggesting that DRT systems benefit the doubly constrained population, namely the elderly population in localities with few public services.","2021-10","2025-08-09 09:14:19","2025-08-09 09:14:19","2025-08-09 09:14:19","103202","","","96","","Journal of Transport Geography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/M9CNTUPR/Knierim und Schlüter - 2021 - The attitude of potentially less mobile people towards demand responsive transport in a rural area i.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, challenges persist, including societal acceptance, operational and traffic integration, and regulatory frameworks. This study addresses these barriers through a systematic literature review using the PRISMA framework, analyzing 486 articles from Scopus and Web of Science. The review focuses on key themes such as public perception, operational strategies, traffic impacts, safety considerations, and policy development. The results reveal that public acceptance of ABs varies widely across socio-demographic and cultural contexts. Adoption is notably higher among younger, wealthier, and technologically savvy individuals, highlighting the importance of targeted awareness campaigns. Operational strategies such as demand-responsive services, platooning, and skip-stop routes have demonstrated the potential to enhance the efficiency and appeal of ABs, optimizing both service delivery and user satisfaction. Traffic integration remains a critical factor, with ABs shown to improve traffic flow and reduce emissions in mixed-traffic environments. However, obstacles remain in managing ABs within heterogeneous traffic conditions, particularly in regions with diverse vehicle types and road usage patterns. Safety concerns, a central barrier to widespread adoption, require robust communication systems, emergency response protocols, and standardized safety frameworks to ensure passenger and pedestrian trust. Policy recommendations emerging from the review emphasize phased implementation, supportive regulatory frameworks, and pilot programs to build public trust and operational credibility. These findings underscore the transformative potential of ABs while highlighting the necessity of inclusive policies, comprehensive safety measures, and adaptive operational strategies to maximize their impact in diverse urban and rural settings.","2025-04-28","2025-08-09 10:08:21","2025-08-09 10:08:21","2025-08-09 10:08:21","338","","1","6","","Discov Sustain","Driving the future of sustainable public transport","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/JMFBB8AW/Hadid et al. - 2025 - Driving the future of sustainable public transport a literature review on challenges and strategies.pdf","","","Public transport; Autonomous bus; PRISMA; Public acceptance; Traffic impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose car-user-oriented and sustainable operating principles and embody them in a passenger matching model. Furthermore, we employ a solution approach including the spatial-temporal pruning strategies and a heuristic algorithm to guarantee the efficiency of larger-scale computing. Applying this system to the case of Beijing, results demonstrate that buspooling services could yield significant benefits to passengers, operators, and the environment. The consistency observed between the distribution of taxi trips and bus routes suggests that buspooling could effectively enhance subway accessibility, especially for residents in suburban areas.

Several studies highlighted that introducing Demand Responsive Transport Services (DRTs) can improve PT performance in these areas. In Italy, several DRTs have been launched, characterized by flexible schedules with different operational configurations: fixed route, with and without detours and flexible route. Considering the importance of sharing lessons from pilots, the paper presents a DRT pilot study, conducted in Palermo (Italy) within the WEAKI TRANSIT project, identifying strategies for planning and designing on-demand shared systems. The pilot was conducted in a suburban area in the north of Palermo, covering about 10.5 km2 with the neighbourhoods of Partanna Mondello and Tommaso Natale. This area is poorly served by PT companies with low-frequency and low-reliability bus lines, thus a stop-based DRT service with two fixed routes and detours was hypothesized. The pilot was conducted during November and December 2022, with four cars, operating from 3 to 7 p.m., except Sunday. The service, free of charge, was addressed to students and teaching staff by University of Palermo. Through SP surveys, simulation model and pilot, we evaluate operational performance of the services (i.e. travel distance, waiting and in-vehicle times). We found the introduction of DRTs lead to increasing accessibility to main transit hubs and facilities, and a decrease in waiting times at stops and travel times. Nevertheless, considerations about financial feasibility and legal framework are highlighted.","2025","2025-08-09 11:41:27","2025-08-09 11:41:27","2025-08-09 11:41:27","895-902","","","90","","Transportation Research Procedia","Transforming travel experience in low density areas","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/FGWI7TEA/D’Orso et al. - 2025 - Transforming travel experience in low density areas evidence from a DRT pilot study and simulation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reverse this trend, it is crucial to leverage the technology of connecting users and vehicles online and use it to strengthen public transport, which can be achieved by integrating on-demand pooled services with existing fixed-line services. We propose an efficient and practical integration idea: namely, to complement fixed bus lines with a fleet of smaller vehicles that follow flexible (on-demand) routes side-by-side with the fixed routes, so that part of the demand that would have used the fixed line can ride the flexible service instead. With this scheme, a smaller bus fleet is required, partially compensating for the increase in operators’ costs stemming from the flexible vehicles. This integration strategy favors mostly two types of users: those traveling in low-demand periods, through lower waiting times, and those located far from the bus stops, because the on-demand vehicles can reduce their access time. We develop simulations in real-world scenarios from Santiago, Chile, and Berlin, Germany, for the cases of human-driven and automated vehicles. Results show that when vehicles are automated: (i) A small number of on-demand vehicles can reduce average walking times from approximately 12 to 2 min while reducing operators’ costs, leading to a Pareto improvement, (ii) A larger number of on-demand vehicles can diminish total costs by 13%–39%, through a reduction in users’ costs, although increasing operators’ costs. If vehicles are not automated, total costs are reduced by more than 10% in all of the scenarios analyzed, but a Pareto improvement is not always possible. In general, this mixed fixed/on-demand system outperforms the use of on-demand ridepooling only. Results are more promising in Berlin, because large buses are cheaper in Santiago and run more crowded, so it is more costly to partially replace them by smaller vehicles.","2024-12","2025-08-09 11:44:52","2025-08-09 11:44:52","2025-08-09 11:44:52","104289","","","190","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/RSMH37IM/Fielbaum et al. - 2024 - Improving public transportation via line-based integration of on-demand ridepooling.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the temporal variations in traveler preferences for flexible bus services remain largely unexplored in existing research. This constrains the realization of adaptive and customized solutions. Therefore, this study attempts to develop a distinct method for strategic planning of a flexible bus service. To this end, a combinatorial method is undertaken: quantitative social research (questionnaires) and spatial analysis. This combinatorial approach is applied at Korinth and Loutraki in Greece, two significant rural areas neighboring the Athens Metropolitan Area. The results signify that cost and time are the most crucial factors affecting the use of a flexible service. Furthermore, respondents preferred a door-to-door service in the morning and a stop-based service in the afternoon/evening. Concerning route planning, eight routes with different purposes are suggested (e.g., train feeder, touristic, etc.) covering adequately both urban and rural parts of the study area. Notably, the applied methodological approach can be a guideline for planners and policymakers, assisting them in finding effective strategies for introducing flexible public transport in rural areas, especially in contexts where collective transport culture is limited.","2024-12","2025-08-09 11:47:20","2025-08-09 11:47:20","2025-08-09 11:47:20","1476-1500","","4","4","","","Route Planning for Flexible Bus Services in Regional Cities and Rural Areas","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/PMMQFRGR/Tsigdinos et al. - 2024 - Route Planning for Flexible Bus Services in Regional Cities and Rural Areas Combining User Preferen.pdf","","","flexible transport; on-demand transport; regional cities; route planning; stated preferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thanks to information and communication technologies, on-demand transit (ODT) is a potential solution being proposed and considered by transit agencies. Although ODT has shown the potential to enhance transit level of service, its efficiency depends on different parameters such as demand spatial and temporal distribution or the configuration of the service. In this study, we propose a novel configuration for an ODT service and apply it to the first part of a commuter’s trip, or the commuter’s “first mile.” The proposed configuration depends on the availability of smart devices installed at bus stops. Passengers request their rides via smart devices and receive real-time and personalized information about their ride requests to travel to a PTH. The proposed ODT service is modeled with the Simulation of Urban Mobility or SUMO simulation framework. To evaluate the performance of the ODT service, it is applied to the city of Terrebonne in Quebec, Canada. The proposed service is compared with existing bus transit operating in the area as well as a door-to-PTH service. The results of the comparison analysis reveal that the proposed ODT service may result in a significant 36% reduction in total travel time as well as a 41% reduction in detour time compared with the existing bus transit service. A detailed sensitivity analysis is also conducted to capture the impacts of different parameters, variables, and dispatching algorithms on the service performance.","2024-11","2025-08-09 11:52:36","2025-08-09 11:52:36","2025-08-09 11:52:36","122-136","","11","2678","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","Innovative On-Demand Transit for First-Mile Trips","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/8KYPQEVL/Meshkani et al. - 2024 - Innovative On-Demand Transit for First-Mile Trips A Cutting-Edge Approach.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On one hand, fully flexible demand-responsive feeder services (DRFSs) efficiently tailor their service to the needs of the passengers. On the other hand, traditional feeder services provide predictability and easier cost control. In this article, a semi-flexible DRFS is considered, which combines positive characteristics of both traditional services as well as fully flexible services. This feeder service has two types of bus stops: mandatory bus stops and optional bus stops. Mandatory bus stops are guaranteed to be visited by a bus within a certain time interval. Optional stops are only visited when there is demand for transportation nearby. The performance of this feeder service is optimized with the use of a new type of metaheuristic framework, which we denote as parameter space search. Experimental results on small benchmark instances indicate that the heuristic performs on average 12.42% better than LocalSolver, a commercial optimization solver, with an average runtime of 2.1 s.

We hypothesize that joint optimization of service headway and slack time per trip for route deviation is essential for designing a schedule for the operation of an integrated SFT that can meet both fixed-route and paratransit demand. An integrated SFT has the potential to lower the cost of transportation for regular transit users (both operators and riders) while redirecting potential paratransit riders to less expensive transit modes; thus, reducing demand for overwhelmed paratransit services operating with limited resources. The optimization problem has three competing objectives: minimizing operator costs, minimizing user costs, and maximizing service benefits. Two state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms NSGA-II and SMPSO are compared to obtain the most representative deterministic Pareto optimal solution set. This study has three major contributions. First, quantile regression is used to suggest multiple slack time values for a given headway that transit planners can consider when generating a static schedule for SFT operation. Second, relationships derived to analyze cost trade-offs suggest that headway governs operator cost and is negatively correlated, user cost is positively and equally influenced by both variables, and slack time governs service benefit and is positively correlated. Third, sensitivity analysis for an integrated SFT operation reveals that low-capacity minivans and standard vans offer higher vehicle occupancy and cost efficiency, mostly economical for low to medium demand (5-20 pass/hr), low permissible deviation from the fixed route is desirable during peak hours to avoid delays for passengers on-board, and extreme weather conditions dramatically and negatively influence costs. Policy recommendations for integrated SFT implementation include a recommendation for fare structure design addressing service equity through surcharges/discounts, vehicle technology and service booking technology advancements for cost reduction, and fleet mix design through estimation of passenger loading profile. The application of the study methodology is demonstrated for a low-demand bus route in Regina, Canada.","2023","2025-08-09 12:06:23","2025-08-09 12:06:23","2025-08-09 12:06:23","30591-30608","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/RPDBAKQN/Mishra und Mehran - 2023 - Optimal Design of Integrated Semi-Flexible Transit Services in Low-Demand Conditions.pdf","","","Costs; Optimization; Schedules; Paratransit; Analytical models; Flyback transformers; Minimization; semi-flexible transit; Sensitivity analysis; service headway; slack time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
