This paper presents an alternative ﬂexible-route transit system, in which each bus is allowed to travel across a predetermined area to serve passengers, while these bus service areas collectively form a hybrid ‘‘grand’’ structure that resembles huband-spoke and grid networks. We analyze the agency and user cost components of this proposed system in idealized square cities and seek the optimum network layout, service area of each bus, and bus headway, to minimize the total system cost. We compare the performance of the proposed transit system with those of comparable systems (e.g., ﬁxedroute transit network and taxi service), and show how each system is advantageous under certain passenger demand levels.

Trip-making behaviour has already changed considerably as lifestyles change and they will continue to change in the future. This work reflects and places emphasis on profound thinking about the possibilities, rather than predicting them. Thoughts about possibilities for the future draw upon imagination, perceived and justified feasibility, and lessons gained from the past. This work attempts to capture the possibilities, logistics and travel modes of future urban transportation. A visionary, feasibility-related approach grounded in a realist perspective is proposed, only conceptually, to explore plausible visions for the future. In addition, this work shows the inefficiency of using private cars (PCs) and argues that in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, PCs cannot provide a solution competitive with the potential that urban transportation systems have for the future. Hence, the solutions for the future must be based on public transport (PT) modes of travel, regardless of whether they are metro, bus, light rail, tram, ridesharing services, an ordinary taxi, personal rapid transit, or any other PT-based future mode. The key principal of operation for the mobility of a smart city will be the ability to optimize the connectivity of movement in order to approach a seamless move, while endowing the phrase door-to-door travel with new meaning. Finally, it would be remiss not to mention the unforeseeable implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for future mobility, more controllable by automation of non-privately owned vehicle, and with the prospect of people demonstrating a greater inclination towards changing their habits, behaviour, and thinking paradigms.","2021-10-02","2025-08-07 12:34:15","2025-08-07 12:34:15","2025-08-07 12:34:15","455-479","","4","25","","","Urban mobility and public transport","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/12265934.2020.1799846","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/CPIJUWIJ/Ceder - 2021 - Urban mobility and public transport future perspectives and review.pdf","","","public transport; Future urban mobility; innovative travel modes; mode shift; private car","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An understanding of service reliability is necessary to develop strategies that help transit agencies provide better services. However, few studies have been conducted analyzing bus reliability in the metropolis of China. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of service reliability based on bus operational characteristics in Beijing. Three performance parameters, punctuality index based on routes (PIR), deviation index based on stops (DIS), and evenness index based on stops (EIS), are proposed for the evaluation of bus service reliability. Reliability involves routes, stops, punctuality, deviation, and evenness. The relationship among the three parameters is discussed using a numerical example. Subsequently, through a sampling survey of bus lines in Beijing, service reliability at the stop, route, and network levels are estimated. The effects of route length, headway, the distance from the stop to the origin terminal, and the use of exclusive bus lanes are also analyzed. The results indicate low service reliability for buses in Beijing and a high correlation between service reliability and route length, headway, distance from the stop to the origin terminal, and the provision of exclusive bus lanes.","2009-10-01","2025-08-07 12:35:43","2025-08-07 12:35:43","2025-08-07 12:35:43","722-734","","8","43","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Public transport; Bus; Evenness; Punctuality; Routes; Service reliability; Stops","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various options for increasing the share of environmentally friendly transport through electric buses and trolleybuses are considered, and an assessment and a comparative analysis of the options are given. Features of planning the work of drivers, drawing up the schedule, and considering safety requirements are considered.Intensive growth in the level of motorization of the population, an increase in the number of business trips, the use of light vehicles with small volumes of freight, and the emergence of ""commercial"" routes have led in recent years to a sharp increase in car flows in urban transport systems. In this regard, a whole range of tasks arises related to increasing the comfort of movement and the quality of life of citizens in general, which is possible by optimizing the operation of route (urban) passenger transport and increasing its attractiveness for users of all levels. Experimental and computational-theoretical studies were carried out to improve the work of route passenger (urban) transport of cities (in the example of Polotsk and Novopolotsk). Recommendations are given for further improving the operation of urban passenger transport systems according to alternative scenarios for the cities of Polotsk and Novopolotsk. An assessment is made of the possibility of achieving planned indicators for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from implementing the pilot project measures to improve the quality and efficiency of the route passenger transport in these cities. A comparative analysis of the possibility of developing various electric route passenger transport types is carried out. A map has been developed for reducing emissions of pollutants from vehicles with a change in the population’s mobility structure, an increase in the share of use of route passenger transport, and an increase in the speed of movement of route passenger transport.A methodology for assessing the efficiency of urban passenger transport has been developed, including taking into account the development of electric vehicles, which made it possible to determine the need to purchase appropriate vehicles for organizing the movement of non-rail electric vehicles, create a base for their repair and maintenance; construction of traction substations (new or additional); construction of cable networks; train staff. Also, an algorithm has been developed to implement the least costly activities with limited funding at the initial stage. The studies allowed us to formulate a concept and propose specific comprehensive measures to improve the quality and efficiency of the route passenger transport in Polotsk and Novopolotsk, including optimizing the existing route network of route passenger transport.Studies of the effectiveness of measures aimed at reducing delays in route passenger transport have been carried out, and criteria and places of their application in Polotsk and Novopolotsk have been determined, as well as an assessment of the technical and economic indicators of the proposed options using the international CBA methodology (Cost Benefit Analysis).A business model has been developed to implement standard measures to improve the quality and efficiency of the route passenger transport and increase urban passenger transport’s attractiveness and efficiency.","2025-07-15","2025-08-07 13:10:02","2025-08-07 13:10:02","2025-08-07 13:10:02","060021","","1","3256","","AIP Conf.

This discrepancy often culminates in delays and a decline in ridership, particularly in areas with a heavy reliance on bus transit. A prevalent challenge is the mismatch between actual bus arrival times and their scheduled counterparts, leading to disruptions in fixed schedules. Our study, utilizing New York City bus data, reveals an average delay of approximately eight minutes between scheduled and actual bus arrival times. This research introduces an innovative, AI-based, data-driven methodology for predicting bus arrival times at various transit points (stations), offering a collective prediction for all bus lines within large metropolitan areas. Through the deployment of a fully connected neural network, our method elevates the accuracy and efficiency of public bus transit systems. Our comprehensive evaluation encompasses over 200 bus lines and 2 million data points, showcasing an error margin of under 40 seconds for arrival time estimates. Additionally, the inference time for each data point in the validation set is recorded at below 0.006 ms, demonstrating the potential of our Neural-Net-based approach in substantially enhancing the punctuality and reliability of bus transit systems.","2024-03-04","2025-08-07 13:10:42","2025-08-07 13:10:42","2025-08-07 13:10:42","","","","","","","Real-Time Bus Arrival Prediction","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2303.15495 [cs]","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/NGFFK8TS/Rashvand et al. - 2024 - Real-Time Bus Arrival Prediction A Deep Learning Approach for Enhanced Urban Mobility.pdf","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2303.15495","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To enhance urban mobility, much research was invested in traveling time prediction: given an origin and destination, provide a passenger with an accurate estimation of how long a journey lasts. In this work, we investigate a novel combination of methods from Queueing Theory and Machine Learning in the prediction process. We propose a prediction engine that, given a scheduled bus journey (route) and a ‘source/destination’ pair, provides an estimate for the traveling time, while considering both historical data and real-time streams of information that are transmitted by buses. We propose a model that uses natural segmentation of the data according to bus stops and a set of predictors, some use learning while others are learning-free, to compute traveling time. Our empirical evaluation, using bus data that comes from the bus network in the city of Dublin, demonstrates that the snapshot principle, taken from Queueing Theory, works well yet suffers from outliers. To overcome the outliers problem, we use Machine Learning techniques as a regulator that assists in identifying outliers and propose prediction based on historical data.","2017-03","2025-08-07 13:45:16","2025-08-07 13:47:31","2025-08-07 13:45:16","266-280","","","64","","Information Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/IE9BK3HE/Gal et al. - 2017 - Traveling time prediction in scheduled transportation with journey segments.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PUTSS algorithm integrates artificial intelligence (AI) methods to identify the number of people waiting at each station through real-time image acquisition. The technique presented is Azure Computer Vision. In a case study, the accuracy of correctly identifying the number of persons in an image was computed using the Microsoft Azure Computer Vision service. The proposed PUTSS algorithm also uses Google Maps Service for congestion-level identification. Employing these modern tools in the algorithm makes improving public urban transport services possible.

The term 'shared mobility' includes the modes of carsharing, personal vehicle sharing (peer-to-peer carsharing and fractional ownership), bikesharing, scooter sharing, traditional ridesharing, transportation network companies (or ridesourcing), and e-Hail (taxis). It can also include flexible transit services, including microtransit, which supplement fixed-route bus and rail services. Shared mobility has proliferated in global cities not only as an innovative transportation mode enhancing urban mobility but also as a potential solution to address first- and last-mile connectivity with public transit. It can extend the catchment area of public transportation, potentially playing a pivotal role in bridging gaps in the existing transportation network and encouraging multimodality for first- and last-mile trips rather than driving alone. While public transit is often constrained by fixed routes, driver availability, and vehicle scheduling, shared mobility's 'on-demand' access provides the flexibility that travellers need to access or egress from a bus or rail 'trunk line'. Moreover, shared mobility provides an alternative to costly feeder bus services and land-intensive parking infrastructure. This paper discusses the history of shared mobility within the context of the urban transportation landscape, first in Europe and Asia, and more recently in the Americas, with a specific focus on first- and last-mile connections to public transit. The authors discuss the known impacts of shared mobility modes -carsharing, bikesharing, and ridesourcing – on reducing vehiclemiles/vehicle-kilometres travelled (VMT/VKT), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and modal splits with public transit. The future of shared mobility in the urban transportation landscape is discussed, as mobile technology and public policy continue to evolve to integrate shared mobility with public transit and future automated vehicles.","2016","2025-08-07 14:17:17","2025-08-07 14:17:17","2025-08-07 14:17:17","573-588","","4","42","","","Mobility and the Sharing Economy","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Alexandrine Press","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/R54G66KL/Shaheen und Chan - 2016 - Mobility and the Sharing Economy Potential to Facilitate the First- and Last-Mile Public Transit Co.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
