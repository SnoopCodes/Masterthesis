This paper reviews the existing literature available on ridepooling and related services, specifically focusing on pooling options available from on-demand transportation companies. The paper summarizes the existing knowledge on the use of pooled-ride services, factors in travel mode service options for customers, available policy and planning strategies to incentivize sharing vehicles, and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on shared-ride travel. Overall, research shows that ridepooling options are more likely to be considered by public transit users who have lower household incomes, while ridesourcing users of upper-class backgrounds are less likely to consider moving to a shared-ride service. Travel time and trip cost are the most important factors for travelers determining whether to use a ridesplitting or microtransit service rather than a ride-alone ridesourced trip. Existing policy and planning tools targeting pooled travel or TNCs can be expanded on and specified for on-demand ridepooling services, such as offering better incentives to use shared vehicles and increased access to curb areas or travel lanes, but the most effective strategies will include increasing the user costs for parking or riding alone.","2023-03-01","2025-08-14 10:17:23","2025-08-14 10:17:23","2025-08-14 10:17:23","1368-1381","","3","2677","","","Strangers On This Road We Are On","","","","","","","EN","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/WEXKQ5RA/Hansen und Sener - 2023 - Strangers On This Road We Are On A Literature Review of Pooling in On-Demand Mobility Services.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thereby, an operator controls a fleet of vehicles that serve requested trips on-demand while trips can be shared. In this highly dynamic and stochastic setting, asymmetric spatio-temporal request distributions can drive the system towards an imbalance between demand and supply when vehicles end up in regions with low demand. This imbalance would lead to low fleet utilization and high customer waiting times. This study proposes a novel rebalancing algorithm to predictively reposition idle fleet vehicles to reduce this imbalance. The algorithm first samples artificial requests from a predicted demand distribution and simulates future fleet states to identify supply shortages. An assignment problem is formulated that assigns repositioning trips considering multiple samples and forecast horizons. The algorithm is implemented in an agent-based simulation framework and compared to multiple state-of-the-art rebalancing algorithms. A case study for Chicago, Illinois shows the benefits of applying the repositioning strategy by increasing service rate and vehicle revenue hours by roughly 50% compared to a service without repositioning. It additionally outperforms all comparison algorithms by serving more customers, increasing the pooling efficiency and decreasing customer waiting time regardless of the forecasting method applied. As a trade-off, the computational time increases, but with a termination within a couple of seconds it is still applicable for large-scale real world instances.","2023-08-10","2025-08-14 10:24:23","2025-08-14 10:24:23","2025-08-14 10:24:23","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2308.05507 [eess]","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/G4AIHB2E/Engelhardt et al. - 2023 - Predictive Vehicle Repositioning for On-Demand Ride-Pooling Services.pdf","","","Computer Science - Systems and Control; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2308.05507","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We address this shortcoming by formulating user net benefit stemming from pooling as a compensatory function where the additional travel time and on-board discomfort need to be compensated by the price discount for a traveller to choose a pooled ride over a private ride. The proposed formulation is embedded in a method for matching travel requests and vehicles. We conduct a series of experiments investigating how the potential of ride-pooling services depends on demand characteristics, user preferences and the pricing policy adopted by the service provider.

To do so, we generate a broad range of synthetic, yet plausible demand patterns. We experiment with the number of attraction centres, the dispersion of destinations around these centres, and the trip length distribution. We apply a strategic ride-pooling algorithm across the generated demand patterns to identify shareability potential using a series of metrics related to ridepooling. Our findings indicate that, under a fixed demand level, vehicle-hour reduction due to ride-pooling can range between 18 and 59%. These results depend on the concentration of travel destinations around the centre and the trip length distribution. Ride-pooling becomes more efficient when trips are longer and destinations are more concentrated. A shift from a monocentric to a polycentric demand pattern is found to have a limited impact on the prospects of ride-pooling.","2024-05-03","2025-08-14 10:31:10","2025-08-14 10:31:10","2025-08-14 10:31:10","2140022","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/23249935.2022.2140022","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/FDTM4STE/Soza-Parra et al. - 2024 - The shareability potential of ride-pooling under alternative spatial demand patterns.pdf","","","Travel demand; Shared mobility; Ride-hailing; Ride-pooling; Shareability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early actors include Google and Europe’s CityMobil2, who seek pilot deployments in low-speed settings. This work investigates SAVs’ potential for U.S. urban areas via multiple applications across the Austin, Texas, network. This work describes advances to existing agent- and network-based SAV simulations by enabling dynamic ride-sharing (DRS, which pools multiple travelers with similar origins, destinations and departure times in the same vehicle), optimizing fleet sizing, and anticipating profitability for operators in settings with no speed limitations on the vehicles and at adoption levels below 10 % of all personal trip-making in the region. Results suggest that DRS reduces average service times (wait times plus in-vehicle travel times) and travel costs for SAV users, even after accounting for extra passenger pick-ups, drop-offs and non-direct routings. While the base-case scenario (serving 56,324 person-trips per day, on average) suggest that a fleet of SAVs allowing for DRS may result in vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) that exceed person-trip miles demanded (due to anticipatory relocations of empty vehicles, between trip calls), it is possible to reduce overall VMT as trip-making intensity (SAV membership) rises and/or DRS users become more flexible in their trip timing and routing. Indeed, DRS appears critical to avoiding new congestion problems, since VMT may increase by over 8 % without any ride-sharing. Finally, these simulation results suggest that a private fleet operator paying $70,000 per new SAV could earn a 19 % annual (long-term) return on investment while offering SAV services at $1.00 per mile for a non-shared trip (which is less than a third of Austin’s average taxi cab fare).","2018-01-01","2025-08-14 10:51:15","2025-08-14 10:51:15","2025-08-14 10:51:15","143-158","","1","45","","Transportation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/B7HAXVNM/Fagnant und Kockelman - 2018 - Dynamic ride-sharing and fleet sizing for a system of shared autonomous vehicles in Austin, Texas.pdf","","","Connected and autonomous vehicles; Dynamic ride-sharing; MATSim simulation; Shared autonomous vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate the service quality of ridepooling as compared to bus services, and to simulate bus rides during the evening hours, transport requests are generated using a predictive simulation. To this end, a framework in the programming language R is created, which automatically combines generalized linear models for count regression to model the demand at each bus stop. Furthermore, we use classification models for the prediction of trip destinations. To solve the resulting dynamic dial-a-ride problem, a rolling-horizon algorithm based on the iterative solution of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Models (MILP) is used. A feasible-path heuristic is used to enhance the performance of the algorithm in presence of high request densities.
