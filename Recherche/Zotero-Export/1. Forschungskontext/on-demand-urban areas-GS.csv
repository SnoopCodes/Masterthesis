The on-demand system makes use of minibuses that have neither fixed itineraries nor fixed stops. The minibuses are rerouted online to dynamically accommodate the requests received by the users. To use the on-demand service users communicate, close to their desired departure time, the origin and destination of the trip. If the estimated arrival time at destination fulfills the user acceptance threshold, it will be chosen. In the simulation we allow the user to walk, to use the on-demand service, a bus or a private car. We will consider a large number of scenarios to evaluate the potential costs/benefits of the introduction of an on-demand service. We will also analyze the scalability and the responsiveness of the service. The results suggest that an on-demand public transportation system would be preferred by most users to the private car and to a bus service. This in turn would imply a more efficient and environmentally friendly transportation system.","2015-01-01","2025-08-12 14:54:48","2025-08-12 14:54:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/U7KJ3LR4/Speranza et al. - 2015 - On-demand public transportation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The combination of an on-demand and line-based service holds the promise of improved mobility and increased service coverage. However, to date, it remains unknown whether DRT services deliver these much anticipated improvements. This study presents an assessment framework to evaluate the performance of DRT and related changes in accessibility, and performs an empirical analysis for a recently introduced DRT service in the Netherlands. The framework includes a performance benchmark between DRT and FT based on the computation of generalized journey times of the DRT rides and the FT alternatives, and can help identify whether DRT is used as a complement or a substitute for FT. The framework covers the spatial and temporal dimensions, and the explicit consideration of rejected trips is an integral part of the evaluation. Results suggest large accessibility improvements for DRT users, especially for some underserved origin–destination pairs.","2018-12","2025-08-12 15:03:01","2025-08-12 15:03:01","2025-08-12 15:03:01","879-889","","8","2672","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","The Potential of Demand-Responsive Transport as a Complement to Public Transport","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/HN3V6EL6/Alonso-González et al. - 2018 - The Potential of Demand-Responsive Transport as a Complement to Public Transport An Assessment Fram.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This service, providing advanced, personalized and ﬂexible demandresponsive PT, is offered to speciﬁc clientele, especially commuters. The present work analyzes, for the ﬁrst time, the evolution of this new PT concept across 30 Chinese cities where CB systems are currently in operation or under construction. Unlike conventional bus transit service, CB users are actively involved in various operational planning activities. CB personalizes PT service by using interactive and integrated information platforms, such as internet website, telephone and smartphone. The analysis comprises three components: ﬁrst, a comprehensive examination of the background of CB and its temporal and spatial distribution in China; second, an analysis of the operation-planning process, including elements of online demand collection, network route design, timetable development, vehicle scheduling, crew scheduling, real-time control, and fare design and collection: third, a summary of the results of the examination and analysis, presenting pros, cons and recommendations. The successful implementation of CB in China demonstrates that this new PT service concept can effectively meet the ever-increasing mobility needs of large populations nation-wide. Similarly, the present work can provide a valuable reference for policymakers, academic researchers, PT practitioners and others worldwide.","2015-04","2025-08-12 15:10:08","2025-08-12 15:10:08","2025-08-12 15:10:08","63-76","","","39","","Transport Policy","Analysis of a new public-transport-service concept","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/YUMPNUPH/Liu und Ceder - 2015 - Analysis of a new public-transport-service concept Customized bus in China.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, public transportation represents a demandresponsive transit (DRT) system. This system occupies an intermediate position between route systems and taxi services and ensures flexibility in providing on-demand transport services. The article describes the main technologies that can be used in the DRT system, including those with fixed routes (Flexible-Route Segments, Request Stops) and without fixed routes (DemandResponsive Connector, Feeder Service, Zone Route, Point Deviation). Despite the wide international experience in implementing DRT in practice, there are no clear criteria to determine the conditions, under which it is reasonable to introduce a particular technology of flexible service for passengers. The article systematizes the factors that determine the feasibility of transferring a bus route to the DRT system in particular time intervals and also determines a sequence of actions for the introduction of flexible modes of public transport services. The considered technologies to manage public transportation on demand show that it is possible to combine regular traffic and demand-responsive service, using these modes at different times. Such an approach allows reducing the carrier’s costs while maintaining or even improving the quality of public transportation compared with systems implementing only flexible service modes.","2020","2025-08-12 15:10:44","2025-08-12 15:10:44","2025-08-12 15:10:44","160-166","","","50","","Transportation Research Procedia","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/P6HYJNKA/Gorev et al. - 2020 - Demand-responsive transit systems in areas with low transport demand of “smart city”.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the ability of DRT concepts to provide eﬃcient, viable transport services has been greatly enhanced by the use of transport telematics as demonstrated in a variety of environments across Europe. The success of British local authorities in winning substantial funding under the Rural and Urban Bus Challenge programmes for the implementation of DRT has resulted in widespread interest in ﬂexible forms of transport. It is thus timely to evaluate the impact of this substantial investment. Drawing on the experience of a number of UK schemes, the paper assesses the reasons for the new-found success of what is becoming a relatively well-accepted mode by concentrating on a variety of factors including: service characteristics (particularly route ﬂexibility, ﬂexibility of booking method and pre-booking regime), emerging markets and the overall contribution of DRT to increased social inclusion and intermodality. Impediments to the development of DRT services are highlighted. The paper also discusses current research into the next generation of DRT services and concludes by identifying some key issues for policy-makers concerned with the future implementation of DRT services.","2004-12","2025-08-12 15:11:53","2025-08-12 15:11:53","2025-08-12 15:11:53","323-337","","4","12","","Journal of Transport Geography","Demand responsive transport","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/LTLK9DE5/Brake et al. - 2004 - Demand responsive transport towards the emergence of a new market segment.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although flexible transport services are used increasingly in Europe and the USA as part of the public transport mix where regular services are not sustainable, there are few working examples of these services in urban Australia, although there are many opportunities. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in New South Wales, Australia, the article identifies barriers to greater use of flexible transport services in low-density urban areas. These five sets of barriers include: institutional frameworks such as regulation; economic issues of funding and cost; operational issues such as fleet and vehicles; operator and community attitudes, awareness and cultures; and information and education.

It is crucial to study the feasibility and advantages of these novel systems before implementation to prevent failure and financial loss. In this work, an extensive comparison of demand responsive transport and conventional public transport is provided by incorporating a dynamic routing algorithm into an agent-based traffic simulation. The results show that replacing conventional public transport with demand responsive transport will improve the mobility by decreasing the perceived travel time by passengers without any extra cost under certain circumstances.
