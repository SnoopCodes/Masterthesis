However, several partnerships have failed due to budget constraints and lack of ridership. Furthermore, the limited datasharing agreements restrict the analysis and dissemination of outcomes. This paper analyzes the integration of shared-mobility services into the public transit system using data from pilot programs in Austin, Texas. The use of Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) and microtransit service is evaluated as first-mile-last-mile (FMLM) and door-to-door solutions. The associated TNC, microtransit, and bus transit demand are analyzed using ridership data, and the trip characteristics are discussed and compared. Then, after controlling for confounding variables through matching, a difference-in-differences (DID) model is used to infer the effect of microtransit on bus transit demand. Specifically, by evaluating bus ridership before and after implementing the microtransit program, the DID model estimates the change in bus demand attributed to microtransit. The results suggest that the TNC services, focusing only on FMLM, were not as popular as microtransit services offering FMLM and intrazonal trips. Even though the microtransit trips were longer and, in some cases, the driver response times were higher than for TNC trips. Also, the DID model demonstrates that the microtransit service did not substantially impact the bus transit ridership, suggesting that the trips were mainly used for intrazonal doorto-door trips and not for FMLM trips. A further discussion highlights the need for performance metrics beyond demand and costs to capture the benefits of these partnerships for improving mobility, safety, and customer experience.","2022","2025-08-12 15:48:19","2025-08-12 15:48:19","2025-08-12 15:48:19","100032","","","24","","Journal of Public Transportation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/TAI36AIR/Zuniga-Garcia et al. - 2022 - Integrating shared mobility services with public transit in areas of low demand.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shared Mobility Services can optimally complement local public transportation such as buses and trains, even in rural regions, and support the transformation of transportation. There is already research on Shared Mobility Services in the literature, but there is no comparison between all of Germany-wide and a specific municipality. We were interested in learning to what extent there is acceptance among citizens and what their usage behavior is towards such new alternatives. We also aimed to find out whether there are differences between large cities and rural regions and to what extent they differ from each other. In this case study, interplay was demonstrated using the example of a funded Smart City mobility project in a German rural municipality. The objective was to show whether the potential exists to initiate traffic turnaround with the help of Shared Mobility Services. In a quantitative survey of 418 German citizens, 114 of them from the rural municipality, the acceptance and usage behavior of Shared Mobility Services (in the form of car, bike and e-scooter sharing) was investigated. The results show that participants are very interested in Shared Mobility Services and have already gained initial experience with such services. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive services; for instance, the demand for car sharing is still too low, as many citizens still own a private vehicle. Our results show that citizens are too little informed about Shared Mobility Services and that these services need to be advertised much more strongly and clearly, both in analog and digitally. Our study shows that traffic turnaround can be achieved and that many citizens can imagine greater use of Shared Mobility Services in their everyday lives in the future. However, for this to happen, the necessary infrastructure must be in place in rural regions, and local authorities must motivate citizens with sufficient educational work about what is on offer and how to use it.","2022-12","2025-08-12 15:49:16","2025-08-12 15:49:16","2025-08-12 15:49:16","1229-1240","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/89SLJ4GB/Schaefer et al. - 2022 - The Acceptance and Use Behavior of Shared Mobility Services in a Rural Municipality.pdf","","","shared mobility; acceptance; municipality; rural; travel behavior; UTAUT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate how microtransit services can be integrated with existing public transport solutions (bus, train) as a flexible shared mobility alternative in rural areas and how to make them attractive alternatives to individual car use. We combine large neighborhood search with agent-based modeling and simulation to validate generated schedules for a microtransit service in terms of vulnerability to tardiness in passenger behavior or service provision. This includes the study of how disturbances, such as delays in service provision or late arrivals of passengers affect the stability of a transport schedule concerning a reliable timely delivery to transfer stops. We explore how simulation can be utilized as a means to fine-tune provider policies, e.g., how long vehicles may wait for late passengers before they depart.","2021","2025-08-12 15:52:47","2025-08-12 15:52:47","","332-346","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/FH6HRFP4/Truden et al. - 2021 - Analysis of Schedules for Rural First and Last Mile Microtransit Services.pdf","","","Mobility; Agent-based simulation; Ride-sharing","Mes, Martijn; Lalla-Ruiz, Eduardo; Voß, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, innovative mobility concepts evolve under technological developments. Demand responsive transport (DRT) has been identified in research to meet the challenges and efficiently improve mobility through the concept of ride-pooling. Still, most of these DRT services are being investigated in urban settings with high mobility demand and population density. Research on low-demand regions, such as the Oberharz in Germany, is rarely considered. Moreover, the applied DRT services come with several restrictions regarding stop locations, customer target groups or spatial restrictions. Therefore, this paper fills this gap through spatial and temporal analysis of a real-life, fully flexible and true door-to-door DRT experiment. Over a 6-months period around 38,000 trips took place in the Oberharz. The analysis of these trips shows that an unrestricted DRT service between three main centres (Goslar, Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Osterode) results in main travel axes between these cities while the more remote areas forfeit mobility to these centres of public service provision. Consequently, a feeder-trunk system should be favoured for future DRT services in low-demand areas to sustainably improve mobility in remote regions. The complementary extension of the existing PT through such a DRT service should then meet mobility needs of rural areas to redeem car dependency and improve mobility for all population groups.","2021-01","2025-08-14 07:17:44","2025-08-14 07:17:44","2025-08-14 07:17:44","5-20","","","100","","Transport Policy","How much flexibility does rural public transport need?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/NXFHUITW/Sörensen et al. - 2021 - How much flexibility does rural public transport need – Implications from a fully flexible DRT syst.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One potential benefit of ride sharing is increased system efficiency. However, it is not clear what the trade-offs are between the efficiency gains and the reduction in quality of service. To quantify those trade-offs, an open-source simulation environment is introduced, which is capable of evaluating a large class of operational policies for ride-sharing mobility-on-demand systems. The impact of ride sharing on efficiency and service level is assessed for several benchmark operational policies from the literature and for different transportation scenarios: first a dense urban scenario, then a line-shaped, rural one. Based on the results of these case studies, we find that the efficiency gains in ride sharing are relatively small and potentially hard to justify against quality of service concerns such as reduced convenience, loss of privacy, and higher total travel and drive times. Furthermore, in the assessed scenarios, the relatively low occupancy of the vehicles suggests that smaller vehicles with 4–6 seats, able to handle occasional ride sharing, may be preferable to larger and more expensive vehicles such as minibuses.","2021-09","2025-08-14 07:30:18","2025-08-14 07:30:18","2025-08-14 07:30:18","5811-5816","","9","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/PFBQF9I8/Ruch et al. - 2021 - Quantifying the Efficiency of Ride Sharing.pdf","","","Vehicle dynamics; Public transportation; Urban areas; Benchmark testing; mobility on demand; operational policies; Quality of service; Ride sharing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that the trip density has a major impact on the required ride-hailing ﬂeet size as well as the resulting service (e.g. operation hours, vehicle-kilometers and pooling rate). The simulation results reveal a nonlinear relationship of trip density and ride-hailing service parameters. A linear upscaling of simulation results for a small population sample may yield an overestimation of the ﬂeet size, operating hours and vehicle kilometers.

As a consequence longer travel times to doctors' practices may arise. This study aimed to investigate the mobility behavior of a rural population in terms of medical consultations. Methods: An exploratory mixed-methods design was conducted in the Waldshut district of the federal state Baden-Württemberg in Germany. Focus groups and a single telephone-interview with representatives, occupationally affiliated with mobility in the district (e.g. representatives of public transport, nursing-services or the District Office Waldshut), were performed in 2016 and analyzed using Mayring's structuring content analysis. A questionnaire based on the collected qualitative data was subsequently distributed to a random sample of 1000 adult inhabitants living in the Waldshut district. Quantitative data were analyzed employing descriptive statistics. Results: Qualitatively, four focus groups and one single telephone-interview with a total of 20 participants were performed. Therein the necessity of reaching a nearby general practitioner and the importance of individual motor traffic was emphasized. Novel mobility modes of ride sharing and telemedicine were controversially discussed as future transport and consultation options, respectively. Quantitatively, 277 questionnaires (27.7%) were valid and included in our analysis. Mean age was 51 years (SD = 18.5) and 58% (n = 160) were female. Irrespective of the mode of transport 60% (n = 166) expected to reach their general practitioner within 15 min. Using the possibility of multiple answers 47% (n = 192) stated to use a car in order to reach their general practitioner, public transport was used by 5% (n = 19). Nearly 80% (n = 220) could imagine sharing a car with well-known persons for consultations. Turning to a general practitioner via telemedicine was imaginable for 32% (n = 91). Conclusions: Individual motor car traffic seems to be an important factor in providing accessibility to rural medical care. As a supplementation, web based ride sharing has economic and structural potential for reaching a doctor's practice. However, familiarity and trustworthiness need to be guaranteed within this flexible transport mode. Furthermore, telemedicine may be a future approach in order to reduce travel time to a doctor's practice. © 2018 The Author(s).","2018","2025-08-14 08:09:42","2025-08-14 08:09:42","","","","1","19","","BMC Fam.

A counter-balance force (Extra-detour Effect), occurs when iii) the number of passengers per vehicle increases and users face longer detours. At low demand levels, there is little sharing and the Mohring effect prevails; as demand grows, more passengers per vehicle push for the Extra-detour Effect to dominate; eventually, vehicles run at capacity, and the Better-matching Effect prevails. The last two effects are specific to ODRP as the routes are not fixed but adapted online.

Here we study the effects of the underlying street network topology on the viability of ride bundling analytically and in simulations. Using numerical and analytical approaches we find that system performance can be measured in the number of scheduled stops per vehicle. Its scaling with the request rate is approximately linear and the slope, that depends on the network topology, is a measure of the ease of ridesharing in that topology.

We consider those SAVs likely to replace, in the future, most of the individual vehicles inside urban areas. We address this very large-scale problem with a greedy insertion heuristic that involves a specific filtering system design in order to speed up the decision process and relies on an original network-driven encoding of the routes. Experimental results show that en-route vehicles can be drastically reduced by such systems using a fleet of SAVs of capacity 10, decreasing the vehicle number by more than 98%, compared to a situation where all travel demands would rely on personal vehicles. In addition, thanks to the filtering system, the total execution time can be reduced by almost 97% compared to the classic best-fit insertion heuristic, while maintaining the quality of the solution. This opens the way to the adaptation of our algorithms to a dynamic real-time context.","2024-04","2025-08-14 09:03:53","2025-08-14 09:03:54","2025-08-14 09:03:53","104551","","","161","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/WVWYVRE5/Liu et al. - 2024 - A filtering system to solve the large-scale shared autonomous vehicles Dial-a-Ride Problem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper studies the relationship between the value generated by shared rides and the detours they create for riders. We establish a limit on the sum of value and detour, and we prove that this leads to a tight bound on the Pareto frontier of values and detours in a general setting with an arbitrary number of requests. We explicitly compute the Pareto frontier for one family of city topologies and construct it via simulation for several more networks, including one based on ride-sharing data from commute hours in Manhattan. We find that average detours are usually small, even in low-demand-density settings. We also find that by carefully choosing the match objective, detours can be reduced with a relatively small impact on values and that the density of ride requests is far more important than detours for the effective operations of a shared rides service. In response, we propose that platforms implement a two-product version of shared rides and limit the worst-case detours of its users.

There are great expectations on the impact that driverless demand-responsive transit (DDRT) systems can have on a regional setting. Nevertheless, the application of DDRT in such type of setting has not been widely studied, in particular for scenarios where the system is an addition to the existing alternatives (as characteristic of the early diffusion stage of an innovation). This study provides an assessment of the early-stage operation of a regional DDRT system used by a small portion of the entire potential adopters. A methodological approach is built upon an agent-based model through which the daily operation of a DDRT system is simulated in detail. This approach is applied to a case study in Portugal considering scenarios varying in terms of several operational parameters, adoption rates (from 1 to 20%), and types of services (private versus shared rides). Results show that each vehicle in the DDRT system with shared rides could replace up to 13 private vehicles with a decrease in the vehicle-kilometers traveled of 1%. The DDRT system operation is profitable even with low adoption rates (starting from 2% for the system with shared rides). When considering the adoption rate of 5%, the system with shared rides is 54% more profitable than the one with private rides, but, from the perspective of travelers, shared rides lead to longer waiting times and detours.","2025-06-01","2025-08-14 09:35:02","2025-08-14 09:35:02","2025-08-14 09:35:02","1091-1118","","3","52","","Transportation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/XIRSEE2Y/Patricio et al. - 2025 - Assessing the introduction of regional driverless demand-responsive transit services through agent-b.pdf","","","Demand-responsive transit; Agent-based modeling and simulation; Driverless vehicles; Low-demand areas; Regional transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sequential method of estimating the demand potential of such a collaborative service structure versus its supply side is formalized and studied by simulating synthetic network models. The workflow is set to support planning, to prove the efficiency of integrated solutions, and to reduce uncertainties for market entrants.","2022","2025-08-14 09:37:28","2025-08-14 09:37:28","","1623-1632","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature","Singapore","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/S9AIAAG5/Heinitz - 2022 - Flexible Integrated Transport Systems’ Potential to Unleash Net Benefits in Rural Areas.pdf","","","Mobility on demand; Ridesharing; Mobility as a service; Demand-responsive transport; Demand model; Flexible integrated transport system","Ha-Minh, Cuong; Tang, Anh Minh; Bui, Tinh Quoc; Vu, Xuan Hong; Huynh, Dat Vu Khoa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
