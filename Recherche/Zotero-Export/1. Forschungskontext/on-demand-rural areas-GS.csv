Traditional dial-a-ride services have often been criticised because of their relatively high cost of provision, their lack of ﬂexibility in route planning and their inability to manage high demand. The potential for overcoming these limitations may be realised through the introduction of telematics-based DRT and this has been widely demonstrated, for example, in recent research funded by the European Commission (e.g. the DGXIII-funded SAMPO and SAMPLUS projects). This paper provides an introduction to the concept of telematics-based DRT services and presents the results of the evaluation of a set of DRT technologies and operations at urban and rural sites across Europe. The paper oﬀers discussion in terms of the key issues that inﬂuence the introduction of DRT services.","2003-12","2025-08-07 10:17:54","2025-08-07 10:17:54","2025-08-07 10:17:54","255-270","","4","11","","Journal of Transport Geography","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/2EPLZHGX/Mageean und Nelson - 2003 - The evaluation of demand responsive transport services in Europe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the ability of DRT concepts to provide eﬃcient, viable transport services has been greatly enhanced by the use of transport telematics as demonstrated in a variety of environments across Europe. The success of British local authorities in winning substantial funding under the Rural and Urban Bus Challenge programmes for the implementation of DRT has resulted in widespread interest in ﬂexible forms of transport. It is thus timely to evaluate the impact of this substantial investment. Drawing on the experience of a number of UK schemes, the paper assesses the reasons for the new-found success of what is becoming a relatively well-accepted mode by concentrating on a variety of factors including: service characteristics (particularly route ﬂexibility, ﬂexibility of booking method and pre-booking regime), emerging markets and the overall contribution of DRT to increased social inclusion and intermodality. Impediments to the development of DRT services are highlighted. The paper also discusses current research into the next generation of DRT services and concludes by identifying some key issues for policy-makers concerned with the future implementation of DRT services.","2004-12","2025-08-07 10:40:26","2025-08-07 10:40:26","2025-08-07 10:40:26","323-337","","4","12","","Journal of Transport Geography","Demand responsive transport","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/2WYEY6K3/Brake et al. - 2004 - Demand responsive transport towards the emergence of a new market segment.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The review is based on a working definition of regional public transport with boundaries toward local as well as interregional public transport: Regional public transport (i) targets passengers travelling between separate urban areas or to rural areas and (ii) a majority of the trips are made on a regular basis. Our results suggest that preferences of regional travellers mainly conform to the preferences of local travellers, but some important differences have been revealed. Most notably, on-board comfort is a higher priority for regional travellers and is increasingly important with longer travel times. Network coverage and coordination are also more prominent features of regional public transport, presumably due to the more dispersed nature of regional public transport networks. These differences, and the fact that the prerequisites for regional public transport are in general substantially different compared to local and interregional public transport, support continued use of this categorisation in public transport research. We also conclude that there is a requirement for more knowledge about the specifics of regional public transport, as public transport research, thus far, has been largely focused on local travel. Research areas of particular interest are on-board comfort, operational aspects, travel time improvements, how the environmental impact of public transport services affects modal choice, and the influence of trip length on passenger preferences.","2019-07-22","2025-08-09 13:47:30","2025-08-09 13:47:30","2025-08-09 13:47:30","38","","1","11","","Eur.

Inter alia, increasing the use of public transport is a vital part of the current strategies. In the EU, 29% of citizens live in rural areas, and the provision of traditional public transport in these areas is difficult and, more importantly, inefficient, further complicating its establishment. In this context, demand-responsive transport (DRT) services are presented as a possible solution. Nevertheless, scientific investigations in this domain are sparse and have fallen short of socio-scientific approaches to explain and increase the user acceptance of DRT. Against this backdrop, this systematic literature review presents an analysis of 231 articles on DRT, and a systematic identification of articles with socio-scientific approaches that were subjected to a content analysis (n = 44). This article (1) creates an overview of the development of the research field with a particular focus on user-oriented research, (2) detects a threefold, conflicting performance expectancy towards the services that complicates their success, and (3) identifies a discrepancy between the perception of DRT services and the empirical design of studies. It concludes by systemizing existing research gaps regarding performance expectation, user focus and rurality, and proposes implications for policymakers and practitioners.","2022-09","2025-08-09 13:54:43","2025-08-09 13:54:44","2025-08-09 13:54:43","43-54","","","126","","Transport Policy","The dilemma of demand-responsive transport services in rural areas","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/MLMMN5YY/Schasché et al. - 2022 - The dilemma of demand-responsive transport services in rural areas Conflicting expectations and wea.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ABM builds upon a previous work by the Authors, where flexible and feeder services of a Mass Rapid Transit system were simulated. In this paper, instead of a many-to-one pattern typical of a feeder service, we considered a many-to-many one. The objective is to investigate the conditions that make a DRT more attractive than a FRT in small-sized cities and guide its design considering the demand fluctuation, land-use pattern, service constraints and passenger preferences. A dispatching algorithm for the DRT allows to assign each new trip request to a vehicle, and a couple of origin and destination stops, updating the vehicle schedule in real time. The service includes fixed and virtual stops, allowing request consolidation and balancing operator-related (cost of the service) and user-related (quality of service) needs. The model is applied to Vittoria (Italy), a small city with 60,000 residents in Southern Italy where most trips are made by car, also due to the absence of an urban public transport service. First results highlight the benefits of providing a flexible service compared to a fixed one to minimize detours, waiting times and walking distances experienced by passengers while allowing for a higher shareability and efficiency of the service.","2023","2025-08-09 14:04:03","2025-08-09 14:04:03","2025-08-09 14:04:03","759-766","","","69","","Transportation Research Procedia","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/V32ST767/Calabrò et al. - 2023 - Designing demand responsive transport services in small-sized cities using an agent-based model.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These services, enabled by new technologies and inspired by the shared mobility paradigm, can complement and improve conventional public transport and reduce car use. The methodology was applied to Acireale, a small town in Southern Italy. A redesign of the existing bus network and its integration with a flexible service was formulated. A scenario analysis was carried out by the evaluation of a simple accessibility measure; the computation of the Gini coefficient was performed to measure the social equity of different scenarios. Results show an increase in equity with a lower coverage of traditional lines and the introduction of the on-demand service. This approach based on easy-to-understand indicators can help the strategic planning of such services, which have the potential to find a trade-off between ridership and coverage as both desirable and conflicting goals in public transport planning.","2021-03","2025-08-09 14:09:07","2025-08-09 14:09:07","2025-08-09 14:09:07","12-21","","1","9","","Case Studies on Transport Policy","Addressing the public transport ridership/coverage dilemma in small cities","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/7WCLN7LX/Giuffrida et al. - 2021 - Addressing the public transport ridershipcoverage dilemma in small cities A spatial approach.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
