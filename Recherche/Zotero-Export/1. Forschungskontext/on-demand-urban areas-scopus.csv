We call this problem the on-demand bus routing problem (ODBRP). Given are a fleet of buses with fixed capacity, a set of bus stations and travel times between them, and a set of transportation requests. Each transportation request consists of a set of potential departure and a set of potential arrival bus stations, as well as a time window, that is, an earliest departure time and a latest arrival time. The aim of the ODBRP is to (1) assign each passenger to a departure and arrival bus station and (2) develop a set of bus routes to fulfill each request in time while minimizing the total travel time of all users. We present the static version of the ODBRP, as well as a straightforward large neighborhood search heuristic to solve it. The performance of the heuristic is established by comparing it to an off-the-shelve heuristic solver (LocalSolver). We also use our heuristic to solve (slightly modified instances of) the well-known dial-a-ride problem. The results found by the heuristic for the on-demand bus system are compared to those of a simulated traditional public bus system with fixed lines and timetables. A thorough analysis of the comparison demonstrates that total user ride times can be significantly lower in an on-demand public bus system and shows that an on-demand bus system works best with a large number of small buses.","2022","2025-07-22 09:11:25","2025-07-22 09:11:25","2025-07-22 09:11:25","1417-1453","","3","29","","","The static on-demand bus routing problem","","","","","","","en","© 2021 The Authors.

Given are a high-speed metro network, a set of real-time requests, a set of bus station locations and a fleet of fixed capacity minibuses. Requests have a set of possible departure/arrival bus stations within walking distance of the actual departure/arrival location and have to be served within a certain time window. The aim is to simultaneously (1) decide on the trip type for each passenger (only bus, only metro or mixed), (2) route the on-demand buses, (3) in the case of a bus-leg in the trip, assign each passenger to a departure and arrival bus station (bus station assignment), and (4) in the case of a metro-leg in the trip, decide the assigned transfer station(s) and used metro lines (transfer station assignment).

The results found by the heuristic are further used to compare the performance of an integrated system, to a system that only uses on-demand buses.

A need exists for systematic approaches to developing efficient responses to minimize such negative impacts. We present an optimization-based approach that responds to degradations of urban transit rail networks by introducing smartly designed bus bridging services that take into consideration commuter travel demand at the time of the disruption. The approach consists of three fundamental steps, namely, (1) a column generation procedure to dynamically generate demand-responsive candidate bus routes, (2) a path-based multicommodity network flow model to identify the most effective combination of these candidate bus routes, and (3) another optimization-based procedure to determine simultaneously the optimal allocation of available vehicle resources among the selected routes and corresponding headways. The approach is applied to two case studies defined using actual data. The results show that the proposed approach can be carried out efficiently and that adding nonintuitive bus routes to the standard bus bridging services can significantly reduce the average travel delay. Moreover, the approach distributes delay more equitably. Many realistic operating constraints can also be handled.","2016-08","2025-08-12 07:15:57","2025-08-12 07:15:57","2025-08-12 07:15:57","790-804","","3","50","","Transportation Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/R7DAGF45/Jin et al. - 2016 - Optimizing Bus Bridging Services in Response to Disruptions of Urban Transit Rail Networks.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, the application of this methodology to the Santiago transit system is presented, and the main results obtained are analyzed. The new restructured system, based on a hierarchy of specialized services that complement and coordinate their operations and using an integrated fare scheme, is compared with an optimized version (optimal frequencies) of the current one, a set of direct services, mainly based on the operation of independent itineraries, without fare integration. The most important conclusions are the following: (a) the private operating costs and the social costs of the restructured system, using higher standard buses, are considerably lower than the costs of the current system; (b) these cost reductions allow government authorities to introduce an important number of modernizing measures without subsidies and fare increases.","2008-08","2025-08-12 07:23:56","2025-08-12 07:23:56","2025-08-12 07:23:56","951-972","","7","42","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","Demand responsive urban public transport system design","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/Q76QF2IZ/Enrique Fernández L. et al. - 2008 - Demand responsive urban public transport system design Methodology and application.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ridesourcing services may enhance the transit system in two major ways: replacing underutilized routes to improve operational efficiency, and providing lastmile connectivity to extend transit’s catchment area. While an integrated system of ridesourcing services and public transit is conceptually appealing, little is known regarding whether and how consumers might use a system like this and what key service attributes matter the most to them. This article investigates traveler responses to a proposed integrated transit system, named MTransit, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. We conducted a large-sample survey to collect both revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data and fit a RP-SP mixed logit model to examine the main determinants of commuting mode choice. The model results show that transfers and additional pickups are major deterrents for MTransit use. We further applied the model outputs to forecast the demand for MTransit under different deployment scenarios. We find that replacing low-ridership bus lines with ridesourcing services could slightly increase transit ridership while reducing operations costs. The service improvements offered by ridesourcing mainly come from reductions in wait time. Though relatively small in our study, another source of improvement is the decrease of in-vehicle travel time. Moreover, we find that when used to provide convenient last-mile connections, ridesourcing could provide a significant boost to transit. This finding verifies a popular notion among transit professionals that ridesourcing services can serve as a complement to public transit by enhancing last-mile transit access.","2019-08","2025-08-12 09:19:07","2025-08-12 09:19:07","2025-08-12 09:19:07","683-696","","","105","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","Integrating ridesourcing services with public transit","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/G2HDCGCF/Yan et al. - 2019 - Integrating ridesourcing services with public transit An evaluation of traveler responses combining.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing algorithms consider this as a graph problem and solve it using various graph search algorithms. Unfortunately, this leads to either high query times or suboptimal solutions. We take a different approach. We introduce RAPTOR, our novel round-based public transit router. Unlike previous algorithms, it is not Dijkstra-based, looks at each route (such as a bus line) in the network at most once per round, and can be made even faster with simple pruning rules and parallelization using multiple cores. Because it does not rely on preprocessing, RAPTOR works in fully dynamic scenarios. Starting from arrival time and number of transfers as criteria, it can be easily extended to handle flexible departure times or arbitrary additional criteria. As practical examples we consider fare zones and reliability of transfers. When run on complex public transportation networks (such as London), RAPTOR computes all Pareto-optimal journeys between two random locations an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches, which easily enables interactive applications.","2015-08","2025-08-12 09:23:46","2025-08-12 09:23:46","2025-08-12 09:23:46","591-604","","3","49","","Transportation Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/FFL28AQV/Delling et al. - 2015 - Round-Based Public Transit Routing.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The modes covered include conventional timetabled services .buses, trains etc.), taxis .both single- and multiple-hire), and other demand-responsive services. Tables of estimated aggregate demand are disaggregated so as to produce a stream of fully-articulated travel-requests. Individual requests are resolved as single- or multiple-leg journeys, through the use of request-broking and journey-planning modules that seek to minimise travellers' generalised costs. Journey-legs allocated to demand-responsive modes are handled by a ¯eet-scheduling module which includes provision for ``instantaneous'' as well as advance-notice bookings, and for contingent situations such as breakdowns and passenger no-shows. The ¯eet-scheduling and journey-planning modules are designed as embedded control systems and are intended for use in real-time as well as modelling applications. The paper describes the main analytical and procedural components of LITRES-2, and assesses some methodological issues arising from experience in recent planning studies. The system appears to be well suited for use in modelling situations where the critical issues are concerned with the supply rather than demand side of transportation activity.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the impacts of introducing autonomous buses and taxis on metropolitan transportation systems by quantifying the costs of travel in Japan, and to discuss the potential benefits. First, this study sets the assumptions on autonomous driving technology, including its impacts on vehicle costs, the decreased labor costs for driving and safety monitoring in buses and taxis, and decreased driving stress for private car users. Next, operating costs are computed for autonomous buses and taxis in Japanese metropolitan areas. The costs of travel, or the sum of monetary and time costs, are then computed with and without vehicle automation for different trip types in high- and low-density metropolitan areas. The results highlight that the costs of public transit trips that currently have a smaller share of time costs in overall trip costs could decrease considerably due to vehicle automation. For instance, costs for 10–20-km trip lengths could decrease by 44–61% for taxi trips and 13–37% for rail/bus trips with taxi access, followed by a decrease of 6–11% for bus trips and 1–11% for rail trips with bus access. Further, private car trip costs could decrease by 11–16%. More substantial cost reductions in rail/bus trips with taxi access could occur in the case of smaller trip distances and/or in residential areas far from stations; larger reductions in rail trips with bus access could occur in low-density metropolitan areas. Finally, it is expected that vehicle automation in more fixed modes of public road transit could primarily benefit the transit industry and government, with such effects as improved labor productivity and reduced subsidies, while vehicle automation in more flexible modes could benefit metropolitan residents as well as the transit industry. This further suggests that a deficit of regional bus operations could be recovered during the transition to the full performance of autonomous buses.","2019-08","2025-08-12 09:37:12","2025-08-12 09:37:12","2025-08-12 09:37:12","94-113","","","126","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","Introducing autonomous buses and taxis","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/W9GXPHKB/Abe - 2019 - Introducing autonomous buses and taxis Quantifying the potential benefits in Japanese transportatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the convenience of all kinds of ridesourcing services, the number of ridesplitting passengers increases, which may have a great impact on the urban mobility. In this paper, we analyze ridesplitting behavior and its impact on multimodal mobility, e.g., vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and transportation modal shift, using real-world ridesourcing data extracted from an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China, and questionnaires filled by on-demand ridesplitting passengers. With the consideration of the VKT shifted from non-passenger/private vehicles, this paper uses the saved VKT of two ridesplitting types, e.g., DiDi Hitch and DiDi Express ridesplitting, to quantify the ridesplitting impact. For the whole ridesourcing ecosystem, ridesplitting is estimated to decrease 58,124 VKT per day in Hangzhou, of which Hitch and Express ridesplitting contribute 2175 km and 55,949 km per day, respectively. The saved VKT of Hitch is much smaller than Express ridesplitting for the following two reasons: (1) Hitch orders are fewer than Express ridesplitting; (2) more than half of the Hitch passengers shift modes from bus/metro transit or other non-passenger/private cars.

We develop a strategic network planning optimization model for bus lines that allows for intermodal trips with MoD as a first or last leg. Starting from an existing public transport network, we decide simultaneously on the use of existing line segments in the future fixed-route network, on areas of the city where an integrated MoD service should be offered, on how MoD interacts with the fixed-route network via transfer points, and on passenger routes fulfilling given service-level requirements. The main challenges from a modeling point of view are to capture the interplay between MoD services and the fixed public network, as well as the approximation of MoD costs taking into account that vehicle utilization is a key factor influencing these costs. We develop a path-based formulation and a branch-and-price algorithm, as well as an enhanced enumeration-based approach, to solve real-world instances to proven optimality.

This paper proposes a two-phase optimization procedure to fully unleash the potential of MAEVs by leveraging the strengths of MAEVs, including automatic allocation and charging of modules. In the first phase, a mixed integer programming model is established in the space-time-state framework to jointly optimize the MAEV routing and charging, passenger-to-vehicle assignment and vehicle capacity management for reserved passengers. A Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently.

Services with different passenger-carrying capacities are provided to passengers during a mixed-ﬂeet operation. A fundamental question arising here is how to optimally deploy a given ﬂeet of different bus sizes to provide services that minimize passenger waiting time. We formulate a mixed-ﬂeet vehicle dispatching problem as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model to optimize dispatching schemes (dispatching orders and times) when a given set of buses of different sizes are available to serve demand along a route. The objective is to minimize the average passenger waiting time under time-dependent demand volumes. Stochastic travel times between stops and vehicle capacity constraints (i.e., introducing extra waiting time due to denied boarding) are explicitly modeled. A Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm coupled with a Monte Carlo simulation framework is developed to solve large real-world instances in the presence of stochastic travel times. Results show that, in addition to dispatching headway, bus dispatching sequence can strongly affect waiting times under a mixed-ﬂeet operation. Indeed, with an optimal dispatching sequence, a more accurate adjustment of supply to demand is possible in accordance with time-dependent demand conditions, and the total savings in waiting time are mainly driven by a further reduction in the number of passengers left behind. The optimality of uneven dispatching headways stems from two elements: having a mixed ﬂeet and having localized peaks on demand that make buses run full.","2022-05","2025-08-12 10:07:20","2025-08-12 10:07:20","2025-08-12 10:07:20","263-282","","1","299","","European Journal of Operational Research","Vehicle dispatching plan for minimizing passenger waiting time in a corridor with buses of different sizes","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/KZGDGCPI/Sadrani et al. - 2022 - Vehicle dispatching plan for minimizing passenger waiting time in a corridor with buses of different.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In view of the highly dispersed and regular passenger flow, demand responsive transit is an important complementary means for traditional public transport to improve passenger satisfaction. However, high operating costs and low load factor will have a bad impact on the operation of public transport and reduce passenger satisfaction. In this work, firstly, by analyzing the demand frequency of historical travel stations, the stations with high demand are extracted by time periods as high probability travel points; On this basis, a dynamic vehicle dispatching optimization model is established, and the static vehicle dispatching is carried out with the goal of minimizing the running mileage of the bus system; Finally, based on the initial static route and the later real-time travel demand, the accurate dynamic planning algorithm is used to optimize the dynamic route with the goal of minimizing the change of the system mileage, so as to achieve timely response to the demand.

Vehicles compete for a limited number of order requests, and decentralized stops manage the matching between a customer and a prospective vehicle.

The framework incorporates variable travel speeds and employs a genetic algorithm to optimize routes and operations compared to many studies using constant commercial speed. Experiments conducted in Hwaseong, South Korea, analyzed scenarios with varying service rates, vehicle capacities, and detour ratios. Results show that implementing punctuality-constrained DRT reduces total travel times by 14% compared to subways and 36% compared to buses, highlighting its potential to significantly improve user convenience and operational efficiency.

In view of this, a new adaptive bus route optimization strategy based on the emergency demand responsive public transport is proposed. Firstly, in order to improve the ﬁne-grained passenger carrying capacity of emergency demand responsive public transport and build a clustering model of passenger information, this paper proposes an adaptive clustering algorithm, which considers the main inﬂuencing factors such as vehicle capacity, passenger travel time window and the number of stations visited. Aiming at minimizing the cost of vehicle operation and passenger trafﬁc, a multi-objective optimization model of emergency bus route is constructed based on Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows (VRPTW) to ensure the operation efﬁciency of emergency bus. Secondly, a Modiﬁed Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search with Nearest Vehicle Dispatch (NVD) algorithm (MALNSN) is proposed, which is an extension of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm (ALNS), by improving the generation rules of initial solutions with NVD and operator selection strategy with Modiﬁed Choice Function (MCF), and the effectiveness of algorithm is analyzed according to the Solomon benchmark. The average gain of the proposed MALNSN algorithm is 17.11% higher than that of the original algorithm. Finally, based on the actual road network, experiments are carried out to compare the proposed algorithm with the representative algorithms. The experimental results show that the MALNSN algorithm proposed in this paper can not only ensure the stability of the algorithm, but also formulate a reasonable route optimization strategy in a shorter time, effectively reducing the consumption of transport capacity resources, improving the operation efﬁciency of public transport and increasing the accessibility of public transport. The theoretical analysis was consistent with the experimental results.","2022","2025-08-12 12:08:02","2025-08-12 12:08:02","2025-08-12 12:08:02","5250-5263","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/ZJAY6NJ9/Liu und Wang - 2022 - Data-Driven Bus Route Optimization Algorithm Under Sudden Interruption of Public Transport.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relevant variables are analyzed and numerically modeled by Matlab, and the relationship between fleet size, vehicle capacity and demand density and waiting time, onboard time, vehicle travel distance, and total system cost is analyzed. The results indicate that introducing financial subsidies markedly lowers the critical demand density necessary to ensure system viability. Moreover, subsidy intensity is positively associated with the service’s operational robustness. Through parametric examination, we observe a strictly monotonic relationship between subsidy magnitude and demand thresholds: as subsidy levels increase, the minimum demand requirements for sustainable operation decrease in a consistent, progressive manner; meanwhile, the optimal fleet size exhibits an approximately linear relationship with travel demand per unit area across varying vehicle capacities. Notably, an increase in vehicle capacity corresponds to a decrease in the growth rate of the required fleet size. This model demonstrates robust adaptability across diverse operational scenarios and serves as an effective tool for evaluating the efficiency of resource allocation in demand-responsive transit (DRT) services.

The present study further examines the demand threshold of four public transit systems: DRT, FRT, fixed-route but non-fixed-point transit and dynamic stop transit, which are designated to feed urban rail transit. It constructs user cost models for these four transit systems, where we aim to find the system with the “best” user experience. The demand at which the user costs of two transit systems are equal is referred to as the critical demand. After deriving the analytical expression for the critical demand, a sensitivity analysis of the analytical solution is conducted. The results indicate that DRT is optimal for low demand density scenarios. If we allow more flexibility to transit services compared with FRT, fixed-route but non-fixed-point transit proves superior for higher demand. Additionally, the critical demands between DRT and FRT, as well as that between DRT and fixed-route but non-fixed-point transit, are influenced by the bus speed and passenger walking speed, where the impact has an upper bound; at the same time, the fleet size also affects the critical demands, where the impact has a lower bound.","2025","2025-08-12 12:26:08","2025-08-12 12:26:08","","175-182","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature","Singapore","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/XQ887QKU/Li und Luo - 2025 - Research on the Critical Demand for Different Types of Public Transit Feeder Systems.pdf","","","Critical demand; Public Feeder Systems; User cost","Meng, Lingyun; Qian, Yongsheng; Bai, Yun; Lv, Bin; Tang, Yuanjie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Integrating DRT with mobile data and data analytics enhances understanding of travel patterns and allows the development of improved algorithms to support design-optimised services. This study introduces a replicable framework for DRT that employs an on-demand transport simulator and routing algorithm. This framework is supported by a mobile data set, enabling a more accurate service design grounded on actual demand data. Decision-makers can use this framework to understand traffic patterns better and test a DRT solution before implementing it in the actual world. A case study was conducted in Porto, Portugal, to demonstrate its practicality and proof of concept. Results show that the DRT solution required 135% fewer stops and travelled 81% fewer kilometres than the existing fixed-line service. Findings highlight the potential of this data-driven framework for urban public transportation systems to improve key performance metrics in required buses, energy consumption, travelled distance, and stop frequency, all while maintaining the number of served passengers. Under specific circumstances, embracing this approach can offer a more efficient, user-centric, and environmentally sustainable urban transportation service.","2024-01","2025-08-12 12:38:27","2025-08-12 12:38:27","2025-08-12 12:38:27","4367","","11","16","","","Demand-Responsive Transport for Urban Mobility","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/5D9YIZNS/Melo et al. - 2024 - Demand-Responsive Transport for Urban Mobility Integrating Mobile Data Analytics to Enhance Public.pdf","","","simulation; demand-responsive transportation; data-driven decision making; dynamic routing; mobile data analysis; transport-on-demand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reasonable station and line planning can enhance customized bus competitiveness in residents' travel mode. Most previous studies on optimizing customized bus lines rely on historical passenger volume and travel time to generate static schemes, but the actual operation process of customized bus is often in uncertain circumstances, such as road congestion. The static strategy will occur deviations in this situation. This study proposes a novel planning method to address the above issue. First, a spatiotemporal clustering algorithm is proposed to generate joint stations based on the passenger travel demand. Second, the method models the multiline customized bus optimization problem as a Markov decision process and uses a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to ensure effective training and response to incomplete information scenarios. Finally, the rationality of the proposed planning method is verified in a case study of customized bus area in Chongqing, China.

Intercity ride-pooling service exhibits considerable potential in upgrading traditional intercity bus services by implementing demand-responsive enhancements. Nevertheless, its online operations suffer the inherent complexities due to the coupling of vehicle resource allocation among cities and pooled-ride vehicle routing. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a two-level framework designed to facilitate online fleet management. Specifically, a novel multi-agent feudal reinforcement learning model is proposed at the upper level of the framework to cooperatively assign idle vehicles to different intercity lines, while the lower level updates the routes of vehicles using an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. Numerical studies based on the realistic dataset of Xiamen and its surrounding cities in China show that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the supply and demand imbalances, and achieves significant improvement in both the average daily system profit and order fulfillment ratio.","2024-06","2025-08-12 12:43:47","2025-08-12 12:43:47","2025-08-12 12:43:47","103551","","","186","","Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","Vehicle dispatching and routing of on-demand intercity ride-pooling services","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/HWLDZT5L/Si et al. - 2024 - Vehicle dispatching and routing of on-demand intercity ride-pooling services A multi-agent hierarch.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advent of modular vehicles (MVs) provides opportunities for more flexible and seamless intermodal transit. The MVs, which have been implemented, are comprised of automated modular units (MUs), and can dynamically change the number of MUs comprising them at different times and stops. However, this innovative intermodal urban transit brings with it a new level of dynamism and uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the timetable and the vehicle schedule within an intermodal urban transit network utilizing MVs within the context of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which allows MVs to dynamically (de)couple at each stop and permits flexible circulations of MUs across different transportation modes. We propose a DRO formulation to explore the trade-off between operators and passengers, with the objective of minimizing the worst-case expectation of the weighted sum of passengers’ and operating costs. Furthermore, to address the computational intractability of the proposed DRO model, we design a discrepancy-based ambiguity set to reformulate it into a mixed-integer linear programming model. In order to obtain high-quality solutionss of realistic instances, we develop a customized decomposition-based algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The computational results of real-world case studies based on the operational data of Beijing Bus Line illustrate that the proposed integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling method reduces the expected value of passengers’ and operating costs by about 6% in comparison with the practical timetable and fixed-capacity vehicles typically used in the Beijing bus system.","2024-05","2025-08-12 12:47:33","2025-08-12 12:47:33","2025-08-12 12:47:33","104610","","","162","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","Integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling of an intermodal urban transit network","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/IRME4DK4/Xia et al. - 2024 - Integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling of an intermodal urban transit network A distribution.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a two-phase approach for the collaborative optimization of charging schedules and passenger services, aimed at enhancing the operation of on-demand electric bus systems. First, we propose a label-setting dynamic programming algorithm that enables the efficient generation of bus-trips for each bus line in response to passenger requests. Second, we introduce a time–space network optimization model that facilitates integrated multiple bus-trip planning for the transit network, involving multiple bus lines and charging spots. The model selects bus-trips from various time–space arcs, which represent passenger carrying, bus deployment, and bus charging activities. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a case study using real-world data from bus lines in Beijing, China. Computational results demonstrate that our approach can handle on-demand electric bus operations within minutes of solution time, efficiently serving over 2,000 passengers. Practically, our approach achieves a notable reduction in average transit time and effectively reduces the waste of public transit resources. The proposed approach can serve as a beneficial tool for decision-makers and operators seeking to enhance the performance and environmental impact of their electric bus systems.","2024-01","2025-08-12 12:49:54","2025-08-12 12:49:54","2025-08-12 12:49:54","103372","","","181","","Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/HH2BGF3L/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Routing and charging optimization for electric bus operations.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
