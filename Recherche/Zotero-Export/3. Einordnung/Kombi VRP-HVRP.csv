Although often encountered in practice, the problem, which we call heterogeneous ﬂeet vehicle routing with overloads and time windows (HFVROTW), has not been previously tackled in the literature. We model it by integrating the constraint of the total trip load into the objective function, and solve it via a sequential insertion heuristic that employs a penalty function allowing capacity violations but limiting them to a variable predeﬁned upper bound. Computational results on benchmark problems show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing vehicle costs with minimal capacity violations, thus offering evidence of the signiﬁcance of this VRP variant.","2013-07","2025-08-19 17:02:48","2025-08-19 17:02:48","2025-08-19 17:02:48","68-75","","1","144","","International Journal of Production Economics","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/WTFS8QHD/Kritikos und Ioannou - 2013 - The heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem with overloads and time windows.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the problem is to minimize the total delivery cost. A heterogeneous ﬂeet composed of vehicles with different capacity, characteristics (i.e. refrigerated vehicles) and hourly costs is considered. A limit on the maximum route duration is imposed. Unlike what happens in classical multi-depot VRP, not every customer may/will be served by all the vehicles or from all the depots. The planning horizon, as in most real life applications, consists of multiple periods, and the period in which each route is performed is a variable of the problem. The set of periods, within the time horizon, in which the delivery may be carried out is known for each customer. A Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation for MDMPVRPHF is presented in this paper, and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) based Matheuristic approach is proposed, in which different destroy operators are deﬁned. Computational results, pertaining to realistic instances, which show the effectiveness of the proposed method, are provided.","2016-09","2025-08-19 17:02:53","2025-08-19 17:02:53","2025-08-19 17:02:53","100-112","","","70","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","A real-life Multi Depot Multi Period Vehicle Routing Problem with a Heterogeneous Fleet","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/H8SY9EMW/Mancini - 2016 - A real-life Multi Depot Multi Period Vehicle Routing Problem with a Heterogeneous Fleet Formulation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a new bi-objective programming model defined on a set of vertices, including a depot, a group of customers, and a set of charging stations. The first objective function is the minimization of the total cost of transportation. To meet the growing environmental concerns, we also consider a second objective function which minimizes total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. To solve the bi-objective problem, we integrate three multi-objective solution methods (i.e., weighted-sum, ε-constraint, and hybrid methods) with the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). We thereby generate a set of instances based on real-world locations in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and some parts of Ontario in Canada. These instances are then solved by applying the proposed solution methods. The obtained numerical results from the designed experiments revealed that by enhancing the charging power from 90 kW to 350 kW, transportation costs could decrease by up to 5 %. In addition, by doubling the number of stations in the same service area, delivery companies could lower their transportation costs by 2 %. Furthermore, a slight increase (less than 3 %) in transportation costs leads to a remarkable reduction (more than 18 %) in GHG emissions.","2023-03","2025-08-19 17:03:02","2025-08-19 17:03:02","2025-08-19 17:03:02","119228","","","213","","Expert Systems with Applications","A bi-objective green vehicle routing problem with a mixed fleet of conventional and electric trucks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/C5GLGPVZ/Amiri et al. - 2023 - A bi-objective green vehicle routing problem with a mixed fleet of conventional and electric trucks.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This phenomenon is known as naval gigantism. If, on the one hand, naval gigantism allows to reduce transport costs by exploiting the economies of scale achievable by large ships, on the other hand, it implies a series of operational issues. Indeed, due to their large draft, such giant vessels are not allowed to enter small ports when fully or near-fully loaded, and in some cases, they cannot enter such small ports at all. In fact, their draft can strongly vary depending on the load on board. This implies restrictions for vessels in accessing ports, which impact not only at the strategical level on the fleet sizing problem, but also at the tactical/operational level, on the sequence of port visits among each route. In fact, given a set of ports that a ship has to visit, determining the optimal sequence of visits becomes a very challenging issue, as the sequence that gives the shortest travel distance (i.e., the smallest travel cost) may prove infeasible due to draft limit restrictions for accessing ports. Furthermore, the same sequence of ports, which may be infeasible for a large ship, may become viable if operated by a smaller ship. On the other hand, due to the economy of scale, travel costs per load unit are generally much lower for large ships than for small ones. Therefore, the draft restrictions also affect the fleet sizing problem. In this paper, we introduce the Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Draft Limits (HF-VRP-DL). We propose a mixed integer programming formulation and several valid inequalities to strengthen it. Since the mathematical model is able to handle only small-sized instances, to address larger instances we propose a Large Neighborhood Search matheuristic (LNS) and an Iterated Local Search matheuristic (ILS). Computational tests carried out show excellent performances of the proposed approach. Further analysis is provided on the impact of the instance layout on the computation time required to solve the problem to optimality.","2023-01","2025-08-19 17:03:13","2025-08-19 17:03:13","2025-08-19 17:03:13","106024","","","149","","Computers & Operations Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/MWFBYKKB/Fadda et al. - 2023 - The Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Draft Limits.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research applied a Capacitated Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Depots (CHFVRPMD) model to optimize a retail chain distribution network with a real-world road network. The model attempts to obtain a distribution plan that minimizes the total distribution cost. A hybrid solution algorithm was proposed to solve the CHFVRPMD model. The solution algorithm was developed by combining the heuristic and metaheuristic methods. A case study was carried out to collect actual data to test the proposed optimization model and the solution algorithm. All the input parameters were estimated using a real-world industry application, to minimize the gap between the theoretical model and the real-world applicability. Computation experiments demonstrate the proposed hybrid solution algorithm’s effectiveness in optimizing the CHFVRPMD model in a feasible computational time. The overall findings reveal that the CHFVRPMD model has achieved about 10.7% savings in daily distribution cost, in optimizing the selected retail distribution network. The proposed model and solution algorithm assist industry practitioners to mitigate transport inefficiencies in retail distribution networks.","2022-12","2025-08-19 17:03:23","2025-08-19 17:03:23","2025-08-19 17:03:23","0588-0592","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/J8IBDJ3Q/Fernando et al. - 2022 - Applying a Capacitated Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Depots Model to Opt.pdf","","","Computational modeling; Costs; Heterogeneous fleet; heuristic; Job shop scheduling; metaheuristic; Metaheuristics; multiple depots; Processor scheduling; retail chains; Roads; vehicle routing; Vehicle routing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
