The method was developed to tackle real distribution problems, taking into account most of the constraints that appear in practice. In the MTVRSP, besides the constraints that are common to the basic vehicle routing problem, the following ones are present: during each day a vehicle can make more than one trip; the customers impose delivery time windows; the vehicles have different capacities considered in terms of both volume and weight; the access to some customers is restricted to some vehicles; the drivers' schedules must respect the maximum legal driving time per day and the legal time breaks; the unloading times are considered. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","1997-07","2025-08-19 16:38:02","2025-08-19 16:38:03","2025-08-19 16:38:02","180-191","","1","100","","European Journal of Operational Research","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/ZCQ626AA/Brandão und Mercer - 1997 - A tabu search algorithm for the multi-trip vehicle routing and scheduling problem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optimizing route plans for vehicles allows companies to save a huge amount of operational costs. The VRP problem is also one of the most studied problems in the domain of operations research. There are several variants of the VRP problem that have been considered in the literature. This paper proposes a new variant of the vehicle routing problem taking into account most of the well-studied features, especially with a new constraint on the lower bound of the capacity of vehicles which has not been investigated in the literature. The problem requirements come from one of the biggest dairy distribution companies in Vietnam. With over 1000 customer points included in a plan on average, the company takes at least one working day to make a route plan. We formulate the considered problem as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, analyze the challenges of the lower-bound capacity constraints and propose an adaptive large neighborhood search framework for solving it. Experimental results on large realistic and randomly generated instances show the efficiency and the applicability of the proposed method. The application of the proposed method led to the rapidity in generating the solution; this task that used to take one day is decreased to just two hours.","2022-10","2025-08-19 16:38:12","2025-08-19 16:38:12","2025-08-19 16:38:12","108597","","","172","","Computers & Industrial Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/ZRSZBF48/Nguyen et al. - 2022 - Modeling and solving a multi-trip multi-distribution center vehicle routing problem with lower-bound.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to find an optimal plan for vehicle routing and multi-skilled manpower scheduling in tandem with the objective of minimizing the total cost, including travel and staff costs, without violating time windows and lunch break constraints. To address this, two mathematical models were formulated: an arc-flow model and a trip-based set-covering model. In addition, a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, based on the set-covering model, was proposed to solve practical-scale instances. To determine the feasibility of the integer solutions, we introduce a feasibility check model. To address the multi-trip characteristics of the proposed problem, a novel two-phase column generation algorithm was introduced to solve the subproblem. This approach differs from traditional one-phase labeling algorithms and involves a tailored labeling algorithm for obtaining non-dominated labels in the first phase and a strategy to identify the trip with the minimum reduced cost for each label in the second phase. Furthermore, novel and efficient staff-based inequalities were developed by improving the k-path inequalities. Extensive numerical experiments were conducted to demonstrate the solution performance of the proposed algorithm and reveal managerial insights for non-emergency ambulance operations. The results demonstrate that our algorithm can successfully solve instances with up to 50 patients to optimality within two hours. Moreover, we demonstrated the value of jointly optimizing vehicle routing and staff planning, which can result in significant cost savings of up to 19.4%.","2024-11","2025-08-19 16:38:19","2025-08-19 16:38:19","2025-08-19 16:38:19","31-49","","1","319","","European Journal of Operational Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/3EFCCUAF/Huang et al. - 2024 - An exact algorithm for the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time windows and multi-skilled ma.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a cumulative multi-trip vehicle routing problem with limited duration (CumMTVRP-LD) is modelled by taking into account the reduction of CO 2 emissions. In classical vehicle routing problems (VRP), each vehicle can perform only one trip. Because of the high investment costs of additional vehicles, organizations allow the vehicles to perform multiple trips as in multi-trip vehicle routing problems (MTVRP), which reflects the real requirements better than the classical VRP. This study contributes to the literature by using a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and a simulated annealing (SA) based solution methodology for CumMTVRP-LD, which considers the minimization of fuel consumption as the objective function. According to preliminary computational results using benchmark problems in the literature, the proposed methodology obtained promising results in terms of solution quality and computational time.","2015-08-01","2025-08-19 16:39:11","2025-08-19 16:39:11","2025-08-19 16:39:11","273-284","","4","20","","Environ Model Assess","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/AFVE97DU/Cinar et al. - 2015 - Reduction of CO2 Emissions in Cumulative Multi-Trip Vehicle Routing Problems with Limited Duration.pdf","","","CO 2 Emissions; Heuristic approaches; Mixed integer programming; Multi-trip vehicle routing problem; Simulated annealing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem is named the multi-trip vehicle routing with release dates and interrelated periods (MTVRP-RDIP). The routes may start at different pre-defined periods, called departure periods, and may have different durations. Thus, two routes that start at different periods may be active at the same period, leading to the so-called interrelated periods. Moreover, a route may only start at a period if a vehicle is available, and the availability of the vehicle depends not only on the existing vehicles but also on the active routes at that time period. The clients are classified according to their importance and represent warehouses that require car components that are made available throughout the time horizon, thus leading to the consideration of release dates. Delays in satisfying client orders and not serving orders in the time horizon result in penalty costs that must be minimized. The objective to minimize also includes routing costs and vehicle utilization costs. Two metrics are defined to compute an order's delay, each leading to a different mixed integer linear model. Computational results showed that one model clearly outperforms the other and even this one is only suited to address the smallest instances. A matheuristic based on a rolling-horizon process that iteratively solves the better-performing model with fewer periods was designed to tackle the largest instances. The matheuristic can provide feasible solutions for all test instances in an efficient manner that are, on average, better than the ones provided by the model in most of the compared key performance indicators.","2025","2025-08-19 16:39:16","2025-08-19 16:39:16","2025-08-19 16:39:16","189-204","","2","85","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/net.22258","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/V83GJAQG/Bernardino et al. - 2025 - A Multi-Trip Vehicle Routing Problem With Release Dates and Interrelated Periods.pdf","","","interrelated periods; matheuristic; multi-trip vehicle routing problem; release dates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
