The objective function of the developed model is to minimize the total cost including vehicles’ fixed cost, drivers’ cost, fuel costs, and costs of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. Fleet composition, load, vehicle speed, road slope, and traffic are considered as factors affecting the produced pollution. Considering the NP-Hard complexity of this problem, an Improved Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (IALNS) algorithm is designed to treat the problem efficiently. The performance of the proposed algorithm is enhanced using the Taguchi design method. Finally, Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm and Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) algorithm are considered as two well-known algorithms to test the efficiency of the IALNS algorithm using benchmark problems. Furthermore, a statistical test is conducted to efficiently provide the required comparisons for large-sized problems. It is revealed that the proposed IALNS has a superior performance and can appropriately tackle the problem. Finally, the impacts of the proposed model on cost-saving are evaluated using the proposed IALNS algorithm.","2022-11-02","2025-08-19 16:59:07","2025-08-19 16:59:07","2025-08-19 16:59:07","3165-3193","","11","71","","","The time-dependent multi-depot fleet size and mix green vehicle routing problem","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/02331934.2021.2010078","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/FNFJ8IFK/Alinaghian et al. - 2022 - The time-dependent multi-depot fleet size and mix green vehicle routing problem improved adaptive l.pdf","","","green vehicle routing problem; improved adaptive large neighbourhood search; multiple depots; Time-dependent vehicle routing problem; variable neighborhood search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Production Management Systems for Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous Environments","978-3-031-71645-4","","10.1007/978-3-031-71645-4_19","","The electrification spreads all around the world with the goal of global net zero emission, especially in transportation sector. As a natural consequence of this phenomenon, many countries and organizations announce their targets relating to the Electric Vehicles (EVs). Although shifting from fossil-fuel towards EVs is a major step forward, there are other precious actions to be taken, one of which is to integrate EVs into scientific studies along with the routing improvements. To this end, we introduce the Multi-Depot Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Half-Open Routes and Rotations (MDEVRP-HORR) as an extension of the MDEVRP where the rotation refers to set of all routes assigned to an EV. EVs can be recharged at the depots or at the recharging stations along the route with full recharging strategy. The problem is formulated as a 0–1 mixed integer linear program (MILP) and existing procedures are applied to improve the model. The proposed model relaxes the restriction that the departure depot of the first route and arrival depot of the last route of an EV must be the same. It also avoids from creating dummy nodes for recharging stations and replenishment depots. We conducted experimental studies by using small-sized instances from the recent literature due to problem intractability. Out of 36 instances, results reveal that inclusion of half-open routes leads to a cost reduction for 20 instances. Besides, inclusion of both half-open rotations and half-open routes results in cost reduction for 28 instances.","2024","2025-08-19 16:59:14","2025-08-19 16:59:14","","274-290","","","","","","Multi-depot Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Half-Open Routes and Rotations","","","","","Springer Nature Switzerland","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/KJ7I6TIH/Erdeş und Kesen - 2024 - Multi-depot Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Half-Open Routes and Rotations A Mathematical For.pdf","","","Electric Vehicle; Half-Open Route and Rotation; Multi-Depot Electric Vehicle Routing Problem","Thürer, Matthias; Riedel, Ralph; von Cieminski, Gregor; Romero, David","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several kinds of vehicle routing problems (VRPs) have been studied in the literature. In this paper, we will combine multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) and close–open mixed vehicle routing problem (COMVRP), assuming that the fleet of vehicles is heterogeneous. Also, in this problem, contractors are used to meet a part of customers’ requirements. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total cost of serving customers. To efficiently deal with the problem, a new mixed integer programming (MIP) model as well as a new hybrid metaheuristic is proposed. Moreover, analytic hierarchical process is utilized in hybridization of the genetic algorithm.

The challenge of solving the conflict between profit and environmental consequences in logistics has motivated many studies on the vehicle routing problem. In this paper, a multiobjective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to minimize transportation expenses and pollutant emissions for the multi-depot heterogeneous vehicle routing problem. A metaheuristic is adapted to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions. After a search procedure, decision makers are able to choose among best transportation plans that balance many objectives at once including economic benefits and environmental impacts. Computational experiments are performed on seven well-known benchmark problem sets. The results demonstrate the existence of greener transportation plans, which are illustrated alongside the best solutions previously reported. The study shows that, in return for a minimal economic tradeoff, a substantial amount of pollution could be avoided.","2018-11","2025-08-19 16:59:32","2025-08-19 16:59:32","2025-08-19 16:59:32","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/PEKFILGG/Dao-Tuan und Nguyen-Thi-Ngoc - 2018 - A multi-criteria optimization model for emission-concerned multi-depot vehicle routing problem with.pdf","","","Air pollution; environmental emissions; Green products; Linear programming; Mathematical model; multi-depot vehicle routing problem; multi-objective; Standards; transportation; Transportation; Vehicle routing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 International Conference on Applied Smart Systems (ICASS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
