We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear model for the electric bus multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem with time windows (EB-MDVSPTW). Our formulation considers not only the operational cost of vehicles, but also the waiting times. In addition, it explicitly considers the capacity of charging stations and prohibits the simultaneous charging of different vehicles at the same charger. Chargers are modeled as task nodes of an extended network and can be placed at any location utilizing the charging infrastructure of a city instead of using only bus-dedicated chargers. Further, we linearize the MINLP formulation of the EB-MDVSPTW by reformulating it to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that can be solved to global optimality. Because EB-MDVSPTW is NP-Hard, we also introduce valid inequalities to tighten the search space of the MILP and we investigate the trade-off between the compactness and the tightness of the problem in benchmark instances with up to 30 trips. In the numerical experiments, we show that the valid inequalities reduce the problem’s compactness by increasing up to three times the number of constraints, but, at the same time, improve tightness resulting in computational time improvements of up to 73% in 20-trip instances. The implementation of our exact approach is demonstrated in a toy network and in the benchmark instances of Carpaneto et al. (1989).","2023-04","2025-08-19 16:53:15","2025-08-19 16:53:15","2025-08-19 16:53:15","189-206","","1","306","","European Journal of Operational Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/R44KZWR6/Gkiotsalitis et al. - 2023 - An exact approach for the multi-depot electric bus scheduling problem with time windows.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach consists of solving a sequence of optimization problems, where we take into account different scenarios for future travel times. We discuss the potential benefit of our approach compared to the traditional one, where the vehicle scheduling problem is solved only once for a whole period and the travel times are assumed to be fixed. Because in the multiple-depot case we cannot solve the problem exactly within reasonable computation time, we use a “cluster-reschedule” heuristic where we first assign trips to depots by solving the static problem and then solve dynamic single-depot problems. We use new mathematical formulations of these problems that allow fast solution by standard optimization software. Results of a computational study with real-life data are presented, in which we compare different variants of our approach and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to deviations of the actual travel times from estimated ones.","2004-11","2025-08-19 16:53:21","2025-08-19 16:53:21","2025-08-19 16:53:21","447-458","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: INFORMS","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/6WNXUB5I/Huisman et al. - 2004 - A Robust Solution Approach to the Dynamic Vehicle Scheduling Problem.pdf","","","dynamic scheduling; public transport; stochastic travel times; vehicle scheduling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasing attention paid to environmental problems, how to effectively reduce the energy consumption of block transportation and improve the utilization rate of resources in the factory is the key problem that China’s shipbuilding industry needs to solve at present. This article considers the time windows for block transportation tasks, as well as the self-loading constraints of different types of flat cars, and establishes an optimization model that minimizes the empty transport time and energy consumption of the flat cars as the optimization objective. Then, an Improved Genetic Whale Optimization Algorithm is designed, which combines the cross and mutation ideas of genetic algorithms and proposes a whale individual position updating mechanism under a mixed strategy. Furthermore, the performance and computational efficiency of the algorithm are verified through comparative analysis with other classical optimization algorithms on standard test examples. Finally, the shipyard’s block transportation example proves that the energy-saving ship block transportation scheduling method can effectively improve the efficiency of shipbuilding enterprise’s block transportation and reduce the energy consumption in the block transportation process. It proves the engineering practicality of the green dispatching method proposed in this paper, which can further provide a decision-making method for shipyard managers.","2024-05-11","2025-08-19 16:53:25","2025-08-19 16:53:25","2025-08-19 16:53:25","10796","","1","14","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2024 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/3F6MWNI8/Guo et al. - 2024 - Multi-objective green vehicle scheduling problem considering time window and emission factors in shi.pdf","","","Computational science; Computer science; Information technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To complete this shift, there is a need to build the required charging infrastructure. When the first electric buses were adopted, the charging stations were mostly built in the locations of large bus depots. However, in recent years, there has been a crowding problem in the charging stations resulting in queuing and unnecessary delays. In this study, we explore the potential of replacing single-port charging stations with multi-port charging stations that can serve multiple vehicles at once with a reduced charging rate. Because the charging rate reduces with the number of ports, we develop a mixed-integer linear program to determine the charging schedules of bus fleets in order to reduce the overall delays in the bus network. The novel formulation is tested in benchmark instances of various sizes demonstrating the improvement potential.","2024-01","2025-08-19 16:53:56","2025-08-19 16:53:56","2025-08-19 16:53:56","1305","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/G2NQFNEQ/Chau et al. - 2024 - The Electric Vehicle Scheduling Problem for Buses in Networks with Multi-Port Charging Stations.pdf","","","branch and bound; charging infrastructure; EB-MDVSPTW; electric bus scheduling; mixed-integer linear programming; public transport planning; transport electrification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
