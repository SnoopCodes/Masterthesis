The proposed approach is suitable for obtaining a policy constructed dynamically on the go during the rollout algorithm. The rollout algorithm is part of the Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) lookahead solution approach for a Markov Decision Processes (MDP) framed Multi-Depot Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Road Capacity (MDDVRPSRC). First, a Deterministic Multi-Depot VRP with Road Capacity (D-MDVRPRC) is presented. Then an extension, MDVRPSRC-2S, is presented as an offline two-stage SILP model of the MDDVRPSRC. These models are validated using small simulated instances with CPLEX. Next, two reduced versions of the MDVRPSRC-2S model (MDVRPSRC-2S1 and MDVRPSRC-2S2) are derived. They have a specific task in routing: replenishment and delivering supplies. These reduced models are to be utilised interchangeably depending on the capacity of the vehicle, and repeatedly during the execution of rollout in reinforcement learning. As a result, it is shown that a base policy consisting of an exact optimal decision at each decision epoch can be obtained constructively through these reduced two-stage stochastic integer linear programming models. The results obtained from the resulting rollout policy with CPLEX execution during rollout are also presented to validate the reduced model and the matheuristic algorithm. This approach is proposed as a simple implementation when performing rollout for the lookahead approach in ADP.","2021-01","2025-08-19 16:02:29","2025-08-19 16:02:29","2025-08-19 16:02:29","1572","","13","9","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/YVII3CX5/Anuar et al. - 2021 - A Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Road Capacity and Reduced Two-Stage Stochastic.pdf","","","approximate dynamic programming; matheuristic; reinforcement learning; rollout algorithm; two-stage stochastic programming; vehicle routing problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper proposes a novel solution featuring a three-layer architecture and a system able to simulate the behavior of the network. Therefore, the paper proposes a tool to assess the impact of changes in volumes and capacities on overall delivery times. The integration of information about sorting nodes, delivery nodes, travel distances, and daily item demands is crucial for simulating accurate arrival times at each destination point. Computational experiments are depicted for validating the model and showing its effectiveness and its application.","2025","2025-08-19 16:03:06","2025-08-19 16:03:06","","83-97","","","","","","Capacity Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows","","","","","Springer Nature Switzerland","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/5MKE28Y5/Birtolo et al. - 2025 - Capacity Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows Simulation Tool for Footprint Network Design.pdf","","","Capacity and Time Windows; Digital twin; Logistic Network; Multi-Depot; Vehicle Routing Problem","Kocian, Alexander; Milazzo, Paolo; Henriques Martins, Ana Lúcia; Nanni, Mirco; Pappalardo, Luca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robust solutions then become paramount. One way to achieve robustness in the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Demands (CVRPSD) is to add a measure of the second-stage (recourse) distance to the objective function of the deterministic problem. We adopt variance as a measure of the recourse distance and propose a Mean-Variance (MV) model. To solve the model, a Hybrid Sampling-based solution approach is developed. Numerical experiments are conducted on benchmark instances and a selective waste collection system in Brazil. We compare our model with others from literature which also use a measure of the second-stage distance to attain robustness. The numerical results show that our model generates the most robust solutions. The comparison provides detailed features of each model and their advantages and disadvantages, helping decision-makers decide which model to utilize based on their different needs and priorities.","2023-03-16","2025-08-19 16:04:48","2025-08-19 16:04:48","2025-08-19 16:04:48","254-268","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/19427867.2022.2049547","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/D3RHAUTG/Bernardo et al. - 2023 - Achieving robustness in the capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands.pdf","","","kerbside recycling collection; mean-variance model; robustness; selective waste collection; stochastic demand; stochastic programming; Vehicle routing problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We formulate a mathematical model for a complex vehicle routing problem involving a single depot, a fleet of heterogeneous vehicles with limited capacities, and simultaneous delivery and pickup tasks. Each vehicle type is assigned a specific road network based on vehicle-road compatibility. We develop heuristic approaches to generate high-quality solutions for this problem and compare them with a state-of-the-art commercial solver. Our findings reveal that our heuristics perform exceptionally well for very large problem instances, while the commercial solver outperforms them for smaller instances. Moreover, our algorithms can handle scenarios where customers have either delivery or pickup demands, as well as cases where both operations are required. We evaluate the performance of our exact formulations extending existing data, as well as generate new data sets demonstrating the effectiveness of our bioinspired heuristic methods in achieving satisfactory outcomes.","2023-12","2025-08-19 16:05:32","2025-08-19 16:05:32","2025-08-19 16:05:32","1758-1762","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/GELMMMXT/Banerjee et al. - 2023 - Single Depot Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Delivery and PickUp.pdf","","","Disasters; Heterogeneous Fleet; OR in Disaster Relief; Routing; Simulated annealing; Simultaneous Delivery and PickUp; Task analysis; Temperature distribution; Transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicle Routing Problem; Vehicle-Road Compatibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
