The problem statement and initialization of the development project was made by the Copenhagen Fire-Fighting Service (CFFS). The CFFS needed a new system for scheduling elderly and disabled persons, involving about 50.000 requests per year. The problem is characterized by, among other things, multiple capacities and multiple objectives. The capacities refer to the fact that a vehicle may be equipped with e.g. normal seats, children seats or wheel chair places. The objectives relate to a number of concerns such as e.g. short driving time, high vehicle utilization or low costs. A solution algorithm REBUS based on an insertion heuristics was developed. The algorithm permits in a flexible way weighting of the various goals such that the solution reflects the user's preferences. The algorithm is implemented in a dynamic environment intended for on-line scheduling. Thus, a new request for service is treated in less than 1 second, permitting an interactive user interface.","1995-12-01","2025-08-19 11:08:19","2025-08-19 11:08:19","2025-08-19 11:08:18","193-208","","1","60","","Ann Oper Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/LVXKS3DP/Madsen et al. - 1995 - A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple.pdf","","","Dial-a-ride; dynamic routing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The algorithm uses a sequential insertion procedure to assign customers to vehicles and to determine a time schedule of pick-ups and deliveries for each vehicle. A flexible objective function balances the cost of providing service with the customers’ preferences for pick-up and delivery times close to those requested. and for short ride times.

A transportation schedule must be constructed for a set of available vehicles, and several constraints have to be considered, particularly time windows, which define an upper and lower time bound for each customer request in which a vehicle must arrive to perform the service. Because of the complexity of DARPTW, a number of algorithms have been proposed for solving the problem, mainly based on metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. In this work, a different approach for solving DARPTW is proposed, designed, and evaluated: hyperheuristics, which are alternative heuristic methods that operate at a higher abstraction level than metaheuristics, because rather than searching in the problem space directly, they search in a space of low-level heuristics to find the best strategy through which good solutions can be found.

Particularly, it arises in door-to-door transportation services provided to elderly and impaired people. DARP's main objective is to accommodate as many customers' constraints as possible with minimum operation costs. DARP involves realistic precedence and transit time constraints on the pairing of vehicles and customers. This paper proposes a neural network forecasting approach for DARP with time windows (DARPTW). It develops and compares the results of two-layer and a three-layer artificial neural networks (ANN) which forecast demands, service and travel times based on real-life data provided by a transportation company. Experimental results show that three-layer ANN with hyperbolic tangent (tanh) and sigmoid linear unit (selu) activation functions, coupled with a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer provide the best forecasting results. This paper also develops a data-driven hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (DD-HALNS). DD-HALNS selects the local search operators according to their updated success' rates, which are, in turn, guided by a learning mechanism from previous successful moves and cost savings. It applies four hybridization features: simulated annealing, tabu lists, genetic crossovers, and restarts. Experimental results on DARPTW benchmark instances highlight DD-HALNS’ ability to improve best known routing solutions, while its application on real life instances, from the Canadian city/region of Vancouver, confirms its implementability.","2022-12","2025-08-19 11:33:35","2025-08-19 11:33:35","2025-08-19 11:33:35","101-110","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search; Artificial neural networks; Benchmark testing; Companies; Costs; Data-Driven; Dial-A-Ride Problem; Forecasting; Genetics; Neural Networks; Simulated annealing; Transportation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, an increase in the number of dialysis treatment is noticed. Many dialysis patients treated at dialysis facilities require six trips each week, three trips to dialysis centers and three trips from the dialysis centers. This comes to more than 300 trips each year per patient. This paper focuses on the transportation of patients undergoing the hemodialysis, as they request rides to their treatments. The transportation problem for hemodialysis patients comes with challenges such as the scheduling problems, extra care and support for the patients and the increased cost of the trips. This paper focuses only on reducingthe total cost of transportation. We consider the hemodialysis patients' transportation problem as the problem of determining an optimal routing for a fleet of vehicles used to cover the regular trips requested. The rides must respect some real-life constraints such as the maximum vehicle capacity, availabilityof the vehicle, patient's schedule … etc. The study focuses on the dial a ride problem with a time window (DARPTW), which is a type of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) that is known in the literature as a complex combinatorial optimization problem related to transportation. Mainly used for transporting individuals with requests. In which a set of users must be picked up from an originlocation and they must be delivered to a destination location. The problem is modeled mathematically as a static dial a ride problem (DARP) where the aim or the objectif function is to minimize the total cost of the transportation.","2023-09","2025-08-19 11:34:21","2025-08-19 11:34:21","2025-08-19 11:34:21","525-529","","","","","","Mathematical Model for Dial a Ride Problem with Time Windows, Case","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/S6YTIWE3/Ben Abdelkrim et al. - 2023 - Mathematical Model for Dial a Ride Problem with Time Windows, Case Hemodialysis Patients Transporta.pdf","","","Costs; dial-a-ride problem; Diseases; hemodialysis; Mathematical models; Optimization; Routing; Schedules; transportation; Transportation; vehicle routing problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 International Conference on Decision Aid Sciences and Applications (DASA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
