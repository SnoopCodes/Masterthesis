The problem statement and initialization of the development project was made by the Copenhagen Fire-Fighting Service (CFFS). The CFFS needed a new system for scheduling elderly and disabled persons, involving about 50.000 requests per year. The problem is characterized by, among other things, multiple capacities and multiple objectives. The capacities refer to the fact that a vehicle may be equipped with e.g. normal seats, children seats or wheel chair places. The objectives relate to a number of concerns such as e.g. short driving time, high vehicle utilization or low costs. A solution algorithm REBUS based on an insertion heuristics was developed. The algorithm permits in a flexible way weighting of the various goals such that the solution reflects the user's preferences. The algorithm is implemented in a dynamic environment intended for on-line scheduling. Thus, a new request for service is treated in less than 1 second, permitting an interactive user interface.","1995-12-01","2025-08-19 11:08:19","2025-08-19 11:08:19","2025-08-19 11:08:18","193-208","","1","60","","Ann Oper Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/LVXKS3DP/Madsen et al. - 1995 - A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple.pdf","","","Dial-a-ride; dynamic routing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vehicles of a given fleet with limited capacity depart from and end at a common depot. The travel time of passengers cannot exceed a given multiple of the minimum ride time. Other constraints include vehicle capacity and vehicle route duration. In practice, scheduling is made more complicated by special user requirements and an inhomogeneous vehicle fleet. The transportation of elderly and handicapped people is an important example, as space for wheelchairs is limited and a lift is required. In this study, we present a modified insertion heuristic to solve the DARP with multi-dimensional capacity constraints, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested in simulation. We show that the proposed methodology is effective when compared with the classic algorithms.","2006","2025-08-19 11:08:40","2025-08-19 11:08:40","2025-08-19 11:08:40","195-208","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-3995.2006.00544.x","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/AVYVEK4Y/Wong und Bell - 2006 - Solution of the Dial-a-Ride Problem with multi-dimensional capacity constraints.pdf; /Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/4HIAGNN5/j.1475-3995.2006.00544.html","","","capacity constraints; Dial-a-Ride; elderly transportation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article we assume that the customer is mainly concerned with the drop-off time because it is the most important to the customer. Based on the drop-off time speciﬁed by the customer and the customer’s location, a pick-up time is calculated and given to the customer by the dispatching ofﬁce. We base our formulation on a dynamic fuzzy logic approach in which a new request is assigned to a vehicle. The fuzzy logic algorithm chooses the vehicle to transport the customer by seeking to satisfy two objectives. The ﬁrst reﬂects the customer’s preference and minimizes the time a customer spends in the vehicle, and the second reﬂects the company’s preference and minimizes the distance a vehicle needs to travel to transport the customer. The proposed heuristic algorithm is relatively simple and computationally efﬁcient in comparison with most deterministic algorithms for solving both small and large sized problems.","2014-11","2025-08-19 11:09:36","2025-08-19 11:09:36","2025-08-19 11:09:36","30-40","","","255","","Fuzzy Sets and Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/S7D8NIH3/Maalouf et al. - 2014 - A new fuzzy logic approach to capacitated dynamic Dial-a-Ride problem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem is known under several names, including the Stacker Crane problem and the Dial-a-Ride problem. No theoretical approximation guarantees were known for this problem other than for the cases k=1, /spl infin/ and the trivial O(k) approximation for general capacity k. We give an algorithm with approximation ratio O(/spl radic/k) for special instances on a class of tree metrics called height-balanced trees. Using Bartal's recent results on the probabilistic approximation of metric spaces by tree metrics, we obtain an approximation ratio of O(/spl radic/k log n log log n) for arbitrary n point metric spaces. When the points lie on a line (line metric), we provide a 2-approximation algorithm. We also consider the Dial-a-Ride problem in another framework: when the vehicle is allowed to leave objects at intermediate locations and pick them up at a later time and deliver them. For this model, we design an approximation algorithm whose performance ratio is O(1) for tree metrics and O(log n log log n) for arbitrary metrics. We also study the ratio between the values of the optimal solutions for the two versions of the problem. We show that unlike in k-delivery TSP in which all the objects are identical, this ratio is not bounded by a constant for the Dial-a-Ride problem, and it could be as large as R(k/sup 2/3/).","1998-11","2025-08-19 11:11:28","2025-08-19 11:11:28","2025-08-19 11:11:28","458-467","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 0272-5428","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/R5J53BAS/Charikar und Raghavachari - 1998 - The finite capacity dial-a-ride problem.pdf","","","Books; Chromium; Computer science; Electrical capacitance tomography; Extraterrestrial measurements; Operations research; Space vehicles; Transportation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Cat.

The algorithm was developed for the project ""HubChain"", which proposes an on demand system being integrated with local public transport in the Elde rural region, in northern Germany. Users can request their trips via an online platform by providing the origin and destination as well as the desired arrival or departure time. To solve the problem, ant colony optimization with penalties (ACOP), in which the ants communicate pheromones both locally and globally and meanwhile the constraints are handled by setting penalties, is developed. To validate the results, the proposed algorithm and an exact algorithm were run for multiple test scenarios using the simulation SUMO as a framework. The routes obtained with the proposed algorithm show travel times comparable to the optimal routes, yet obtained in low computation times. This allows therefore the implementation of the proposed ACOP algorithm in a dynamic booking system.","2021-06","2025-08-19 11:12:10","2025-08-19 11:12:10","2025-08-19 11:12:10","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/7C4GMAVF/Tang und Armellini - 2021 - An ant colony algorithm with penalties for the dial-a-ride problem with time windows and capacity re.pdf","","","Ant colony optimization; Complex networks; Computational modeling; Heuristic algorithms; Intelligent transportation systems; Vehicle dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 7th International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
