In each of these problems, we consider three kinds of constraints that are often found in reality, i.e., vehicle capacity, route duration and budget constraints. To tackle the problems, we propose a new Modular Heuristic Algorithm (MHA) whose exploration and exploitation strategies enable the algorithm to produce promising results. Extensive computational experiments show that MHA performs impressively well, in terms of solution quality and computational time, for the three problem classes.","2015-01","2025-08-19 16:46:50","2025-08-19 16:46:50","2025-08-19 16:46:50","9-23","","","53","","Computers & Operations Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/EFMBM4H7/Rahimi-Vahed et al. - 2015 - Fleet-sizing for multi-depot and periodic vehicle routing problems using a modular heuristic algorit.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disposal of biohazardous medical waste requires strict monitoring due to potential environmental and public health risks. In developing countries, several constraints present as challenges to medical waste disposal, including inaccessible biohazardous disposal plants, limited in-facility biohazardous waste storage, government regulation, and cost. Surabaya, Indonesia’s second-largest city, experiences these challenges. Currently, the Surabaya Health Department (SHD) relies on third-party waste processing vendors to handle infectious waste from 63 health facilities due to hazardous waste disposal only being permitted at the provincial level. In addition, waste collection occurs monthly for most health facilities, with a regulated 14-day storage period to prevent accumulation which contradicts the minimum 25-kg threshold that third-party vendors implement. This study utilizes Surabaya’s context to develop an effective medical waste disposal and transportation strategy and logistics using the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP). Results indicate that the 14-day storage requirement benefits SHD and vendors, improving operational efficiency and mitigating risks. Compliance with storage regulations reduces travel distances compared to scenarios without storage requirements. This study’s methodology applies to developing countries exhibiting similar constraints and acts as a guideline to develop similar medical waste disposal strategies.","2025-03-01","2025-08-19 16:48:47","2025-08-19 16:48:47","2025-08-19 16:48:46","830-847","","2","27","","J Mater Cycles Waste Manag","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/3KFLJRNJ/Anityasari et al. - 2025 - Analysing medical waste transportation using periodic vehicle routing problem for Surabaya public he.pdf","","","Medical waste; Optimization; Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem; Waste management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to changes in customers’ demands, changes in a planned combination of customers to be visited in various days, traffic changes, etc., a sequence of visiting customers by competitors will be changed. So, planning for serving customers ahead of competitors will be uncertain. On the other hand, total transportation costs are also of high importance in distribution of goods. By keeping this issue in mind, we develop a bi-objective mathematical model to evaluate a Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) with time windows under uncertainty for companies competing to provide services to customers. The model is established using an improved scenario-based robust optimization approach. Given that the PVRP is an NP-hard problem, an Improved Differential Evolution (IDE) algorithm is used to identify efficient solutions for the model. The results on small-scale problems were compared with those obtained using the CPLEX solver. To evaluate the performance of the proposed IDE algorithm, a few sample tests on large-scale problems are conducted, and the results are compared with those derived using two other differential evolution algorithms. The findings show that the IDE algorithm exhibits suitable accuracy and performance in solving the presented model.","2018-11","2025-08-19 16:48:54","2025-08-19 16:48:54","2025-08-19 16:48:54","4626-4634","","11","22","","KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering","Robust Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows under Uncertainty","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/BM8ZQCHU/Salamatbakhsh-Varjovi et al. - 2018 - Robust Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows under Uncertainty An Efficient Algorithm.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therein, customers require one or several visits during a planning horizon of several periods. The possible visiting patterns (schedules) per customer are limited. In the classical PVRPTW, it is common to assume that each customer requires a specific visit frequency and offers all corresponding schedules with regular intervals between the visits. In this paper, we permit all kinds of schedule structures and the choice of the service frequency. We present an exact branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm for the classical PVRPTW and its variant with flexible schedules. The pricing problems are elementary shortest-path problems with resource constraints. They can be based on one of two new types of networks and solved with a labeling algorithm, which uses several known acceleration techniques, such as the 𝑛⁢𝑔 n ⁢ g -path relaxation and dynamic halfway points within bidirectional labeling. For instances in which schedule sets fulfill a certain symmetry condition, we present specialized improvements of the algorithm, such as constraint aggregation and symmetry breaking. Computational tests on benchmark instances for the PVRPTW show the effectiveness of our algorithm. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different schedule structures on run times and objective function values.
