Yet, the problem characteristics and assumptions vary widely and few literature reviews have made an effort to classify the existing articles accordingly. In this article, we present a taxonomic review of the VRP literature published between 2009 and June 2015. Based on an adapted version of an existing comprehensive taxonomy, we classify 277 articles and analyze the trends in the VRP literature. This classiﬁcation is the ﬁrst to categorize the articles to this level of detail.","2016-09","2025-08-16 14:21:37","2025-08-16 14:21:37","2025-08-16 14:21:37","300-313","","","99","","Computers & Industrial Engineering","The vehicle routing problem","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/VQQK98PS/Braekers et al. - 2016 - The vehicle routing problem State of the art classification and review.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An increasing number of researchers are studying vehicle routing problems (VRPs) and their variants considering real-life applications and scenarios. Furthermore, with the rapid growth in the processing speed and memory capacity of computers, various algorithms can be used to solve increasingly complex instances of VRPs. In this study, we analyzed recent literature published between 2019 and August of 2021 using a taxonomic framework. We reviewed recent research according to models and solutions, and divided models into three categories of customer-related, vehicle-related, and depot-related models. We classified solution algorithms into exact, heuristic, and meta-heuristic algorithms. The main contribution of our study is a classification table that is available online as Appendix A. This classification table should enable future researchers to find relevant literature easily and provide readers with recent trends and solution methodologies in the field of VRPs and some well-known variants.","2021-01","2025-08-17 07:42:19","2025-08-17 07:42:19","2025-08-17 07:42:19","10295","","21","11","","","The Vehicle Routing Problem","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/DPNK8UKJ/Tan und Yeh - 2021 - The Vehicle Routing Problem State-of-the-Art Classification and Review.pdf","","","meta-heuristics; exact methods; heuristics; literature review; taxonomy; vehicle routing problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diversity of applications has motivated the study of a myriad of problem variants with different attributes. In this article, we provide a concise overview of existing and emerging problem variants. Models are typically reﬁned along three lines: considering more relevant objectives and performance metrics, integrating vehicle routing evaluations with other tactical decisions, and capturing ﬁne-grained yet essential aspects of modern supply chains. We organize the main problem attributes within this structured framework. We discuss recent research directions and pinpoint current shortcomings, recent successes, and emerging challenges.","2020-10","2025-08-17 07:47:47","2025-08-17 07:47:47","2025-08-17 07:47:47","401-416","","2","286","","European Journal of Operational Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/EYVMDI53/Vidal et al. - 2020 - A concise guide to existing and emerging vehicle routing problem variants.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
