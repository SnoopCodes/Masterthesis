This shared automated mobility system is expected to provide a seamless door-to-door service for urban travellers, much like what the existing transportation network companies (TNC) do, but with decreased labour cost and more flexible relocation operations due to the vehicles’ automation. We propose an integer non-linear programming (INLP) model that optimizes the routing of the ATs to maximize the system profit, depending on dynamic travel times, which are a non-linear function of the ATs’ flows. It is important to involve traffic congestion in such a routing problem since for a growing number of ATs circulating in the city their number will lead to delays. The model is embedded within a rolling horizon framework, which divides a typical day into several horizons to deal with the real-time travel demand. In each horizon, the routing model is solved with the demand at that interval and assuring the continuity of the trips between horizons. Nevertheless, each horizon model is hard to solve given its number of constraints and decision variables. Therefore, we propose a solution approach based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, which allows identifying a near-optimal solution for this difficult problem. Numerical experiments for the city of Delft, The Netherlands, are used to demonstrate the solution quality of the proposed algorithm as well as obtaining insights about the AT system performance. Results show that the solution algorithm can solve the proposed model for hard instances. Ride-sharing makes the AT system more capable to provide better service regarding delay time and the number of requests that can be attended by the system. The delay penalty on the profit objective function is an effective control parameter on guaranteeing the service quality while maintaining system profitability.","2020-03","2025-08-14 14:34:05","2025-08-14 14:34:05","2025-08-14 14:34:05","260-281","","","112","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/E6DNYHAC/Liang et al. - 2020 - Automated taxis’ dial-a-ride problem with ride-sharing considering congestion-based dynamic travel t.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Highly flexible, but very costly direct transportation is often offered as a complement to standard fixed route public transport service. In the integrated dial-a-ride problem (IDARP), these modes of transport are combined and certain legs of the passengers journeys may be performed with the fixed route public transport system. We extend the IDARP and include timetables for the fixed route services, forcing the fleet of vehicles to schedule the arrival at transfer locations with care. Two mixed integer linear programming formulations of the integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetables are presented and analyzed. The key modeling challenge is that of the transfers between the fleet of vehicles and the fixed route public transport system. The formulations differ in how the transfers are modeled and the differences are thoroughly discussed. The computational study compares the formulations in terms of network size, computational time and memory usage and conclusions about their performances are drawn.","2017-07-01","2025-08-14 17:23:04","2025-08-14 17:23:04","2025-08-14 17:23:04","217-241","","1","9","","Public Transp","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/3KDV354L/Posada et al. - 2017 - The integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetabled fixed route service.pdf","","","Cost effectiveness; Dial-a-ride; Mobility; Multimodal transport; Operational planning; Optimization; Paratransit; Public transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transporation Res. Part B: Methodological 81(1):267–288.]. The R-DARP, as a variant of the classic dial-a-ride problem (DARP), consists of determining a set of minimum-distance trips for vehicles to transport a set of clients from their origins to their destinations, subject to side constraints, such as capacity constraints, time window constraints, maximum riding time constraints, and manpower planning constraints. Our problem extends the R-DARP by (1) changing its objective to first maximizing the number of requests satisfied and then minimizing the total travel distance of the vehicles, and (2) generalizing the lunch break constraints of staff members. To solve this problem, we propose a two-phase branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm based on a strong trip-based model. The trip-based model is built on a set of nondominated trips, which are enumerated by an ad hoc label-setting algorithm in the first phase. Then we decompose the trip-based model by Benders decomposition and propose a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm to solve the decomposed model in the second phase. Our two-phase exact algorithm is tested on the R-DARP benchmark instances and a set of new instances generated according to the same real-world data set as the R-DARP instances. Our algorithm quickly solves all of the R-DARP instances to optimality and outperforms the branch-and-cut proposed by Liu, Luo, and Lim.

While the driver as a person of trust currently provides security, passengers are alone with strangers in an autonomous ridepooling vehicle. In the paper, we address this aspect by including incompatibilities between customers, meaning that incompatible customers cannot share the vehicle at the same time. Although incompatibilities can be defined in any way by the provider, they can be set, for example, if a customer feels unsafe in sharing the vehicle with customers of a certain type. As other compatible customers can replace the driver as a person of trust, we present a second setting where all customers are allowed to share the vehicle at the same time, but customers are never alone in the vehicle with incompatible customers. We present Branch-and-Cut algorithms for both problem settings including methods to improve the search with respect to the incompatibilities. We show in a computational study that the introduced methods improve the search significantly and evaluate the Branch-and-Cut algorithms on realistic instances with up to 120 customers and 10 vehicles. Moreover, our results suggest that it can be a beneficial option for the provider to allow their customers to participate in the decision process by indicating incompatibilities for types of customers, meaning that they do not want to share a vehicle with a customer of an incompatible type.","2024-01","2025-08-16 13:52:36","2025-08-16 13:52:36","2025-08-16 13:52:36","103394","","","181","","Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/ZR7MA6SW/Schulz und Pfeiffer - 2024 - A Branch-and-Cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem with incompatible customer types.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to solve this “modular dial-a-ride problem” (MDARP). A heuristic algorithm based on Steiner-tree-inspired large neighborhood search is developed to solve the MDARP for practical scenarios. A set of small-scale synthetic numerical experiments are tested to evaluate the optimality gap and computation time between exact solutions of the MDARP using commercial software and the proposed heuristic. Large-scale experiments are conducted on the Anaheim network with up to 75 vehicles and 150 requests considering 378 candidate join/split nodes to further explore the potentials and identify the ideal operation scenarios of MVs. The results show that MV technology can save up to 52% in vehicle travel cost, 41% in passenger service time, and 29% in total cost against existing on-demand mobility services in the scenarios tested.

In the present work, it is assumed that the requests assigned to the drivers have been selected, and the transportation plan has been established for the next day. However, in practice, appointment durations may vary due to unforeseen circumstances, and some transportation requests may be modiﬁed, delayed or canceled during the day. The aim of this work is to propose a reactive algorithm which can adapt the initial plan in order to manage the disruptions and to take care of as many patients as possible in real-time. The plan should be modiﬁed quickly when a perturbation is observed, without resorting to major changes which may confuse the drivers and the patients. Several recourse procedures are deﬁned for this purpose. They allow the dispatcher to temporarily delete a request, to insert a previously deleted request, or to permanently cancel a request. Simulation techniques are used to test the approach on randomly generated scenarios. Several key performance indicators are introduced in order to measure the impact of the disruptions and the quality of the solutions.","2020-02","2025-08-16 13:56:59","2025-08-16 13:56:59","2025-08-16 13:56:59","953-969","","3","280","","European Journal of Operational Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/JWX2LES4/Paquay et al. - 2020 - Recovery management for a dial-a-ride system with real-time disruptions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, modeling such dynamic events for dial-a-ride (DAR) systems has not been addressed until now; this is the research gap we attempt to address in this article. The following are the contributions of our work: 1) the formulation of a disruptive DAR problem (DDARP) with VB (DDARP-VB), 2) a GPU-based adaptive large neighborhood search (G-ALNS) algorithm to solve the DDARP-VB, and 3) a fleet size minimization (FSM) strategy that leads to reduced operational costs under disruptions. From our simulations, the proposed G-ALNS algorithm performs up to 52 times faster than its CPU counterpart and produces better solutions when compared to the existing GPU approach for DARPs. Overall, our FSM strategy leads to a 59% reduction in fleet idle time under normal operations and a 15% reduction in operational cost under disruption.","2020","2025-08-16 13:58:58","2025-08-16 13:58:58","2025-08-16 13:58:58","219-234","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/WZZARXIZ/Ramasamy Pandi et al. - 2020 - Disruption Management for Dial-A-Ride Systems.pdf","","","Optimization; Vehicle dynamics; Electric breakdown; Graphics processing units; Intelligent vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part I focuses on the ""static"" case of the problem. In this case, intermediate requests that may appear during the execution of the route are not considered. A generalized objective function is examined, the minimization of a weighted combination of the time to service all customers and of the total degree of ""dissatisfaction"" experienced by them while waiting for service. This dissatisfaction is assumed to be a linear function of the waiting and riding times of each customer. Vehicle capacity constraints and special priority rules are part of the problem. A Dynamic Programming approach is developed. The algorithm exhibits a computational effort which, although an exponential function of the size of the problem, is asymptotically lower than the corresponding effort of the classical Dynamic Programming algorithm applied to a Traveling Salesman Problem of the same size. Part II extends this approach to solving the equivalent ""dynamic"" case. In this case, new customer requests are automatically eligible for consideration at the time they occur. The procedure is an open-ended sequence of updates, each following every new customer request. The algorithm optimizes only over known inputs and does not anticipate future customer requests. Indefinite deferment of a customer's request is prevented by the priority rules introduced in Part I. Examples in both ""static"" and ""dynamic"" cases are presented.","1980","2025-08-16 14:58:01","2025-08-16 14:58:01","2025-08-16 14:58:00","130-154","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: INFORMS","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/9M5L4YSI/Psaraftis - 1980 - A Dynamic Programming Solution to the Single Vehicle Many-to-Many Immediate Request Dial-a-Ride Prob.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We look at two types of mobility services, private and shared. Our problem extends the dynamic DARP by (i) changing its objective function to profit maximization, where both cost and revenue are variables, and (ii) incorporating assortment optimization with routing decisions in a dynamic setting. We propose a pricing scheme based on a choice model designed to offer service alternatives at the time a customer makes a request.

Here we address this issue in the context of a dynamic and stochastic patient transportation problem, where besides considering new events, we also incorporate stochastic information about future events. We propose different anticipatory algorithms and investigate which algorithm performs best according to the given settings in a real-world application. We therefore address different types of dynamic events, appropriate response times, and the synchronization of real-world data with the plan. In order to test and analyze how the algorithms behave and perform, we apply the concept of a digital twin. The implemented anticipatory algorithms compared here are a sample scenario planning approach and two waiting strategies. The question of the value of more sophisticated algorithms compared to algorithms with less computational effort is investigated. The experimental results show that solution quality beneﬁts from incorporating information about future requests, and that simple waiting strategies prove most suitable for such a highly dynamic environment. We ﬁnd that in highly stochastic environments, a rescheduling should be done whenever a new event occurs, whereas in less stochastic environments it is better to let the optimization engine run a bit longer and not start reoptimization after every new event.","2022-09","2025-08-16 17:00:58","2025-08-16 17:00:58","2025-08-16 17:00:58","591-608","","2","301","","European Journal of Operational Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/J2W6FEQW/Ritzinger et al. - 2022 - Comparison of anticipatory algorithms for a dial-a-ride problem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Customers ask for a transportation service either in advance or in real-time and get an immediate answer about whether their requests are accepted or rejected. The main goal is to maximize the number of accepted requests during the service while respecting maximum capacity of limited number of vehicles. In this study, we propose novel methods based on reinsertion techniques to improve Padam’s online system. The proposed reinsertion techniques aim to exploit the neighborhood of a solution and must be run in real-time whenever a request is rejected by an online system. Three main online reinsertion heuristics based on different neighborhoods are proposed. The first heuristic called HDR uses destruction and repair operators, the second heuristic called GH (graph heuristic) uses the ejection chain concept, and allow modeling the reinsertion problem as a constrained shortest path problem on directed graph built from a current solution, and the third heuristic called IGH (improved graph heuristic) based on GH with intensive exploration of the neighborhood. Our proposed approaches were extensively tested on real and hard instances provided by Padam. These instances contain up to 1011 requests and 14 vehicles and with very tight time windows. The obtained results revealed the performance of the proposed reinsertion methods compared to the online heuristic, where the number of served requests is increased and the number of vehicles is reduced while maintaining operating costs close to those of the online system. The results confirm the interest of using reinsertion techniques in the dynamic DARP service.","2020-11","2025-08-16 17:01:14","2025-08-16 17:01:14","2025-08-16 17:01:14","101199","","","47","","Journal of Computational Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/33AUD9ND/Vallee et al. - 2020 - New online reinsertion approaches for a dynamic Dial-a-Ride Problem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem consists of calculating route plans to meet a set of transportation requests by using a given heterogeneous vehicle fleet. These transportation requests can be either static or dynamic, and all of them must be attended to. In the first stage of the proposed heuristic, the problem’s static part is solved by applying a General Variable neighborhood Search based algorithm. In the second stage, the dynamic requests are dealt with by implementing a simple insertion heuristic. We create different instances based on the real data provided by a Brazilian city’s public health care system and test the proposed approach on them. The analysis of the results shows that the higher the level of dynamism, i.e., the number of urgent requests on each instance, the smaller the objective function value will be in the static part. The results also demonstrate that a higher level of dynamism increases the chance of a time window violation happening. Besides, we use the weighted sum method of the two conflicting objectives to analyze the trade-off between them and create an approximation for the Pareto frontier.","2022-01-01","2025-08-16 17:01:22","2025-08-16 17:01:22","2025-08-16 17:01:22","355-374","","1","16","","Optim Lett","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/PQHPKMNB/Souza et al. - 2022 - Bi-objective optimization model for the heterogeneous dynamic dial-a-ride problem with no rejects.pdf","","","Vehicle routing; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic DARP; General variable neighborhood search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The E-ADARP considers the following perspectives: (i) a weightedsum objective that minimizes both total travel time and total excess user ride time; (ii) the employment of electric autonomous vehicles and a partial recharging policy. This paper presents the first labeling algorithm for a path-based formulation of the DARP/E-ADARP, where the main ingredient includes: (1) fragment-based representation of paths, (2) a novel approach that abstracts fragments to arcs while ensuring excess-user-ride-time optimality, (3) construction of a sparser new graph with the abstracted arcs, which is proven to preserve all feasible routes of the original graph, and (4) strong dominance rules and constant-time feasibility checks to compute the shortest paths efficiently. This labeling algorithm is then integrated into Branchand-Price (B&P) algorithms to solve the E-ADARP. In the computational experiments, the B&P algorithm achieves optimality in 71 out of 84 instances. Remarkably, among these instances, 50 were solved optimally at the root node without branching. We identify 26 new best solutions, improve 30 previously reported lower bounds, and provide 17 new lower bounds for large-scale instances with up to 8 vehicles and 96 requests. In total 42 new best solutions are generated on previously solved and unsolved instances. In addition, we analyze the impact of incorporating the total excess user ride time within the objectives and allowing unlimited visits to recharging stations. The following managerial insights are provided: (1) solving a weighted-sum objective function can significantly enhance the service quality, while still maintaining operational costs at nearly optimal levels, (2) the relaxation on charging visits allows us to solve all instances feasibly and further reduces the average solution cost.","2024-08","2025-08-16 17:01:40","2025-08-16 17:01:40","2025-08-16 17:01:40","103011","","","186","","Transportation Research Part B: Methodological","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/D5A755YH/Su et al. - 2024 - A Branch-and-Price algorithm for the electric autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
