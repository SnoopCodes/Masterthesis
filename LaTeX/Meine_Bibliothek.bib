	abstract = {When demand for transportation is low or highly variable, traditional public bus services tend to lose their efficiency and typically frustrate (potential) passengers. In the literature, a large number of demand-responsive systems, that promise improved flexibility, have therefore been developed. At present, however, a comprehensive survey of these systems is lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a unifying framework that classifies all demand-responsive public bus systems. The classification is mainly based on three degrees of responsiveness: dynamic online, dynamic offline, and static. For each system we discuss the specific optimization problem modeled, whether realistic data is considered, and the size of the instances used for testing. Where possible, we try to draw conclusions on the current state of the literature and try to identify potential avenues for future research. Different tables are included to structure and summarize the information of all papers.},

	abstract = {On-Demand Bus is a Demand Responsive Transit ({DRT}) service that passengers will be transported by the vehicles after they reserve a seat. The vehicle wonpsilat move if there is no reservation and the efficiency is expected as a new transportation service. It allows potential passengers to request service via the Internet or mobile phone, with requests for ride being processed by a server computer. The requests compose of pick-up location, delivery location and desired delivery time (or pick-up time). The computer executes two main algorithms which are vehicle-choosing algorithm and routing algorithm. Using the vehicle-choosing algorithm was used for decision about which vehicle will accept the new request. And the routing algorithm was used to design the new route and schedule for the vehicle chosen to serve the new request. After calculation, the system will report to the customer whether the request is accepted or not. If it is accepted, the vehicle will pick up and deliver him to his destination within a guaranteed time - not later than the desired delivery time (or not earlier than pick-up time). We also carried out an experiment to evaluate the developed algorithm worked as we designed.},

On-demand transport is an emerging mode of urban passenger transport that relies on meeting passenger demand for travel using dynamic and flexible scheduling using shared vehicles. Initially, a simulation model was developed to replicate existing fixed-schedule bus performance and was then extended to incorporate on-demand transport services within the same network. The simulation results were used to undertake a comparative analysis which included reliability, service quality, operational efficiency, network-wide effectiveness, and environmental impacts. The results showed that on-demand buses reduced average passenger trip time by 30\%, increased vehicle occupancy rates from 8\% to over 50\%, and reduced emissions per passenger by over 70\% on an average weekday compared to fixed-schedule buses. This study also offers insights for successful on-demand transport implementation, promoting urban sustainability. It also outlines future research directions, particularly the need for accurate short-term passenger demand prediction to improve service provision and passenger experience.},

Given are a set of buses with fixed capacity, a set of bus stations and a set of transportation requests, only part of which are known before the planning horizon. A request consists of a set of possible departure and arrival stations, as well as an earliest departure and latest arrival time. The aim is to (1) assign each passenger to a departure and arrival bus station and (2) develop a set of bus routes to fulfill each request within its time window while minimizing the sum of the total waiting time and the total user ride time. Including the possibility for requests to be issued after the start of the planning horizon, i.e., when buses have already started servicing other requests, requires a dynamic re-optimization of a partially executed solution. Compared to the case in which all requests are known beforehand, the solution quality, expressed as the total waiting and user ride time, is expected to decline. This decline in objective function value can be seen as the “cost” of the dynamic requests. In this paper, we introduce the real-time {ODBRP} as an extension of its static problem variant and present a heuristic to deal with dynamic requests. In addition, an extensive set of experiments allows us to conclude that dynamic requests indeed lead to higher waiting and user ride times, especially for passengers who submit their request at the last minute. Passengers are therefore encouraged, if possible, to send their request well in advance, as this results in lower and more stable service promises, higher customer satisfaction, and higher revenues for the operating on-demand bus company.},

We also use our heuristic to solve (slightly modified instances of) the well-known dial-a-ride problem. The results found by the heuristic for the on-demand bus system are compared to those of a simulated traditional public bus system with fixed lines and timetables. A thorough analysis of the comparison demonstrates that total user ride times can be significantly lower in an on-demand public bus system and shows that an on-demand bus system works best with a large number of small buses.},

	abstract = {On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence ({AI}), Internet of Things ({IoT}), and Cloud and Fog computing—is helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand ({FMoD}) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual ‘use cases’ that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of {FMoD} and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.},

In this problem, the platform plans customized bus routes upon receiving a batch of orders released by passengers and informs the passengers of the planned pick-up and drop-off locations. The related decision process takes into account some passenger-side time window-related requirements, walking limits, the availability and capacities of various types of buses. A mixed-integer linear programming model of this new {VRP} variant with floating targets (passengers) is formulated. To solve the model efficiently, a solution method is developed that combines the branch-and-bound and column generation algorithms and also includes embedded acceleration techniques such as the multi-labeling algorithm. Experiments based on real data from Dalian, China are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and efficiency of the algorithm; the small-scale experimental results demonstrate our algorithm can obtain optimal results in the majority of instances. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted, and model extensions are investigated, to provide customized bus service platform operators with potentially useful managerial insights; for example, a platform need not establish as many candidate stops as possible, a wide range of walking distance may not bring early arrival at destinations for customers, more mini-buses should be deployed than large buses in our real-world case. Moreover, the rolling horizon-based context and zoning strategies are also investigated by extending our proposed methodology.},

Requests have a set of possible departure/arrival bus stations within walking distance of the actual departure/arrival location and have to be served within a certain time window. The aim is to simultaneously (1) decide on the trip type for each passenger (only bus, only metro or mixed), (2) route the on-demand buses, (3) in the case of a bus-leg in the trip, assign each passenger to a departure and arrival bus station (bus station assignment), and (4) in the case of a metro-leg in the trip, decide the assigned transfer station(s) and used metro lines (transfer station assignment). We call this problem the integrated on-demand bus routing problem. After presenting a mathematical model, we propose a quick and scalable insertion-based heuristic to solve the problem. The results found by the heuristic are further used to compare the performance of an integrated system, to a system that only uses on-demand buses. It is concluded that the integrated system always performs better regarding the service rate or number of served requests. Depending on the speed and layout of the metro network, also the average user ride time per passenger improves by the integration.},

The {ODBRP} belongs to the category of the Dial-A-Ride Problems ({DARP}), and features departure and arrival bus station selection. This problem is specifically aimed at planning a fleet of on-demand buses in an urban environment. However, cities are frequently plagued by traffic congestion, which may cause delays and missed time windows for passengers. To deal with this situation, we introduce, study, and solve a variant of the {ODBRP} in which the travel times are both time-dependent (i.e., the travel time between two nodes depends on the departure time) and updated dynamically. In our approach, congested roads that might cause passenger delays are modeled by frequently updating the travel speed on the road segments that constitute them. The resulting problem is solved by using a K-shortest-path procedure to determine alternative paths between bus stations, as well as a Variable Neighborhood Descent ({VND}) procedure to repair violated time windows. Our experimental results show the overall efficacy of this real-time control under divergent degrees of flexibility (congestion and the number of buses available). Specifically, the average tardiness, maximum tardiness, and the number of late passengers are significantly reduced under a wide range of congestion scenarios, from slight to severe. In addition, this efficacy holds for various ratios of requests to the number of vehicles.},

	abstract = {On-demand ridepooling ({ODRP}) vehicles follow routes that are fully flexible. However, when the system does not provide door-to-door service and users can be asked to walk, their paths tend to concentrate, particularly along main streets that connect highly demanded areas of the city. These frequently travelled segments are hence useful to multiple passengers, which can be used as an indicator that it would be efficient to allocate a fixed public transport line there. In this paper, we formalise this idea and propose a novel method to design a public transport network, where bus fixed lines are combined with {ODRP}. Given a network and a transport demand, we first simulate how to serve it using only {ODRP} with walking. For this, we employ a state-of-the-art assignment algorithm, and take as output the resulting users’ paths. These paths are then processed by a tailored algorithm to create fixed lines where the paths accumulate the most. Users who do not have an available fixed line (i.e., those whose paths were barely shared) are served by {ODRP} in the mixed system. Simulations using real-life data from Utrecht, The Netherlands, and the Sunshine Coast, Australia, reveal the merits of our method compared to several benchmarks. Crucially, our method builds a small number of fixed lines while still serving the majority of the demand through them. This study contributes not only to the design of public transport networks, but also to the understanding of the patterns that naturally appear in intrinsically flexible mobility systems.},

	abstract = {The electric vehicle routing problems ({EVRPs}) with recharging policy consider the limited range of electric vehicles and thus include intermediate visits to charging stations ({CSs}). In general, minimizing the resultant charging costs such as charging duration or charging amount is also part of the objective of the {EVRP}. Accordingly, the {EVRP} has received considerable attention over the past years. Nevertheless, this type of problem in the domain of passenger transportation, a {VRP} variant, has been rarely studied in the literature, especially with time windows, a realistic nonlinear charging function or a partial charging policy. Hence this research extends the existing work on the {EVRP} to the on-demand bus routing problem ({ODBRP}) which transports passengers with the bus station assignment ({BSA}). The resultant problem is the electric {ODBRP} ({EODBRP}). Specifically, each passenger can have more than one stations to board or alight, and they are assigned to the ones with the smallest increase in the total user ride time ({URT}). In the {EODBRP}, frequent intermediate visits to {CSs} are considered. Moreover, a nonlinear charging function is used and the partial charging strategy is applied. To solve the {EODBRP}, a greedy insertion method with a ‘charging first, routing second’ strategy is developed, followed by a large neighborhood search ({LNS}) which consists of local search ({LS}) operators to further improve the solution quality. Experimental data are generated by a realistic instance generator based on a real city map, and the corresponding results show that the proposed heuristic algorithm performs well in solving the {EODBRP}. Finally, sensitivity analyses with divergent parameters such as the temporal distributions of passengers and bus ranges may provide practical guidance.},

The model is solved by a heuristic solution procedure and tested on an idealized linear travel corridor. The case study considers the effects from population density, density distribution, size of residential area, P\&R station location, distance from the residential area to centre business area ({CBD}), as well as the changes of residential area layout and population growth. Results show that P\&R fits for low population density area while {ODPB} is more suitable for high population density area. Population distribution type has little influence on the services’ social welfare. {ODPB} is a preferable service for the city which does not have advanced metro network.

The on-demand system uses minibuses that have neither fixed itineraries nor fixed stops. The minibuses are dynamically routed to accommodate the requests received by the users. To use the on-demand service, users communicate, close to their desired departure time, the origin and destination of the trip. They accept the service if the estimated arrival time at destination fulfills their service level threshold. In the simulation users may decide whether to walk, to use a standard bus, to call the on-demand service, and, if none of these options is satisfactory, to use a private car. We consider different scenarios to assess the potential benefits of the introduction of an on-demand service. We also analyze the scalability and responsiveness of the service. The results suggest that an on-demand system may be able to satisfy a large portion of user transportation requests and may be put beside standard transportation systems in order to provide a better transportation service to the users and substantially reduce the use of private cars.},

In order to find a more effective travel plan to the problem, we adopt Q-learning which is one of the machine learning algorithms. However, native Q-learning is inadequate to our target problem because the number of customers at pick-up points is time-dependent. Therefore, we improve an update process of Q values and a selection process of the next pick-up point, on the basis of time passage parameters. In particular, rewards are understated in update process, on the other hand, Q values are overstated in selection process. At the last, we report our simulation results and show the effectiveness of our algorithm for the problem.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first application of prepositioning in the context of the dynamic stochastic on-demand bus routing problem ({DODBRP}). The {DODBRP} is a large-scale dial-a-ride problem that involves bus station assignment and aims to minimize the total user ride time ({URT}) by simultaneously assigning passengers to alternative stations and determining optimal bus routes. In the {DODBRP}, transportation requests are introduced dynamically, and buses are dispatched to stations with known requests. This paper investigates the concept of prepositioning, which involves sending buses not only to currently known requests but also to requests that are likely to appear in the future, based on a given probability. To solve this dynamic and stochastic {ODBRP}, the paper proposes a heuristic algorithm based on variable neighborhood search ({VNS}). The algorithm considers multiple scenarios to represent different realizations of the stochastic requests. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the prepositioning approach over the {DODBRP} across various levels of forecast accuracy, lengths of time bucket, and probabilities of realization. Furthermore, the paper shows that removing empty stations as a recourse action can further enhance solution quality. Additionally, in situations with low prediction accuracy, increasing the number of scenarios can lead to improved solutions. Finally, a combination of prepositioning, empty station removal, and the insertion of dynamic requests proves to be effective. Overall, the findings of this paper provide valuable insights into the application of prepositioning in the dynamic stochastic on-demand bus routing problem, highlighting its potential for addressing real-world transportation challenges.},

Despite the demand imbalance, traditional public bus systems typically operate with a fixed-route and fixed-timetable scheme in both directions. To increase the efficiency of service during peak hours, in this paper, we propose an on-demand operation that allows vehicles to take some shortcuts between the city center and the terminal, based on the passenger requests that are collected before the peak hours. We develop a variable neighborhood search ({VNS}) algorithm to optimize the operational decisions of this system. Based on the received requests, the {VNS} algorithm decides the following: (1) shortcut decisions: which shortcuts to take by each bus in each direction, (2) departure time decisions: when to depart from the city center and the terminal, and (3) passenger assignment decisions: which service serves each passenger. Experiments show that the total passenger travel time improves up to 45\% on a real-size line compared to its traditional fixed-route operation. The performance of the system is also analyzed under different circumstances.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the design of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems ({ODMTS}) that combine fixed bus/rail routes between transit hubs with on-demand shuttles that serve the first/last miles to/from the hubs. The design problem aims at finding a network design for the fixed routes to allow a set of riders to travel from their origins to their destinations, while minimizing the sum of the travel costs, the bus operating costs, and rider travel times. The paper addresses two gaps in existing tools for designing {ODMTS}. First, it generalizes prior work by including ridesharing in the shuttle rides. Second, it proposes novel fleet-sizing algorithms for determining the number of shuttles needed to meet the performance metrics of the {ODMTS} design. Both contributions are based on Mixed-Integer Programs ({MIP}). For the {ODMTS} design, the {MIP} reasons about pickup and dropoff routes in order to capture ridesharing, grouping riders who travel to/from the same hub. The fleet-sizing optimization is modeled as a minimum flow problem with covering constraints. The natural formulation leads to a dense graph and computational issues, which is addressed by a reformulation that works on a sparse graph. The methodological contributions are evaluated on a real case study: the public transit system of the broader Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The results demonstrate the substantial potential of ridesharing for {ODMTS}, as costs are reduced by about 26\% with respect to allowing only individual shuttle rides, at the expense of a minimal increase in transit times. Compared to the existing system, the designed {ODMTS} also cuts down costs by 35\% and reduces transit times by 38\%.},

In recent years, mobility on demand ({MOD})—where consumers access mobility, goods, and services on-demand by dispatching shared modes, courier services, public transport, and other innovative strategies—has grown rapidly due to technological advancements; changing consumer preferences; and a range of economic, environmental, and social factors. New attitudes toward sharing, {MOD}, and mobility as a service ({MaaS}) are changing traveler behavior and creating new opportunities and challenges for public transportation. This chapter discusses similarities and differences between the evolving concepts of {MaaS} and {MOD}. Next, it characterizes the range of existing public transit and {MOD} service models and enabling partnerships. The chapter also explores emerging trends impacting public transportation. While vehicle automation could result in greater public transit competition in the future, it could also foster new opportunities for transit enhancements (e.g., microtransit services, first- and last-mile connections, reduced operating costs). The chapter concludes with a discussion of how {MOD}/{MaaS} partnerships and automation could enable the public transit industry to reinvent itself, making it more attractive and competitive with private vehicle ownership and use.},

	title = {On-Demand Bus Routing Problem with Dynamic Stochastic Requests and Prepositioning},
	abstract = {The On-Demand Bus Routing Problem ({ODBRP}) is deﬁned as a large-scale dial-a-ride problem with bus station assignment. Speciﬁcally, each passenger can have alternative stations to board and alight; then, station pairs with the smallest total User Ride Time ({URT}) are chosen for overall eﬃciency. In the dynamic {ODBRP} ({DODBRP}), buses are only dispatched to the stations with known requests. However, this paper considers prepositioning: buses are sent to stations where new requests are likely to appear if the expected number of served requests has increased consequently. A heuristic algorithm with variable neighborhood search ({VNS}) is proposed to solve this dynamic and stochastic {ODBRP}, with multiple scenarios representing diﬀerent realizations of stochastic requests. Experimental data show the superiority of prepositioning compared to {DODBRP}.

	abstract = {On-demand mobility services are promising to revolutionise urban travel, but preliminary studies are showing they may actually increase total vehicle miles travelled, worsening road congestion in cities. In this study, we assess the demand for on-demand mobility services in urban areas, using a stated preference survey, to understand the potential impact of introducing on-demand services on the current modal split. The survey was carried out in the Netherlands and offered respondents a choice between bike, car, public transport and on-demand services. 1,063 valid responses are analysed with a multinomial logit and a latent class choice model. By means of the latter, we uncover four distinctive groups of travellers based on the observed choice behaviour. The majority of the sample, the Sharing-ready cyclists (55\%), are avid cyclists and do not see on-demand mobility as an alternative for making urban trips. Two classes, Tech-ready individuals (27\%) and Flex-ready individuals (9\%) would potentially use on-demand services: the former is fairly time-sensitive and would thus use on-demand service if they were sufficiently fast. The latter is highly cost-sensitive, and would therefore use the service primarily if it is cheap. The fourth class, Flex-sceptic individuals (9\%) shows very limited potential for using on-demand services.},

	abstract = {Mobility needs are increasing, as well as noise emission, air pollution and congestion. Traditional mobility solutions are often no longer suitable for these challenges. New approaches for transportation, for example char sharing, are increasing in popularity and availability. Nevertheless many of these solutions are only available in urban areas. In rural or even suburban areas it is often not suitable and cost-efficient to provide public transportation with high frequency and density. Therefor many people in these areas are required to go by car to satisfy their needs. To increase the acceptance and usefulness of public transportation, especially in rural areas, a system for demand-orientated public transportation was proposed. The system was implemented in the German city of Schorndorf as a living lab, to be tested under real-world conditions. The pilot operation has started in March 2018 and the project is scheduled to be in operation till December 2018. This paper will present the challenges involved for provisioning this demand-orientated public transportation system, as well as the preliminary results.},

	shorttitle = {Adaptive Transit Solutions},
	abstract = {As cities worldwide face challenges of rapid urbanization and declining public transit ridership, traditional fixed-route systems often fail to meet evolving mobility needs. Urban planning issues, such as suburban sprawl and fragmented land use, exacerbate these limitations, leading to underutilized services, higher operational costs, and accessibility gaps, particularly for underserved communities. Demand-Responsive Transit ({DRT}) systems have emerged as an effective solution, offering flexible, on-demand services that dynamically adjust routes based on user demand. This review synthesizes insights from 65 studies, including 20 real-world implementations, examining {DRT}'s potential to enhance accessibility, cost efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Key findings demonstrate that {DRT} systems reduce operational costs by 25-35\% while increasing ridership up to 300\%. Integration of {AI}-driven routing algorithms improves service reliability by 90-98\% and reduces travel times by 35-50\%. Multiple booking interfaces increase adoption by 40-60\%, while multimodal integration expands service coverage by 100-150\%. However, significant barriers persist, with 58\% of {DRT} system models requiring subsidies and 51\% facing equity challenges. The study proposes hybrid funding models, integrated multimodal platforms, and inclusive design approaches to address these challenges. By aligning with urban design principles and leveraging advanced technologies, {DRT} systems can enhance urban resilience while promoting sustainable development.},

While demand-responsive transport is sometimes prescribed as an innovative strategy for service provision, the network planning approach to public transport suggests that integrated timed-transfer or pulse timetable networks should be explored first. This paper examines the rural network approach using examples from Switzerland, which has among the highest rates of public transport use in Western Europe, as well as nationally-coordinated Taktfahrplan scheduling that extends deep into rural areas. The basic Swiss pulse timetabling technique is reviewed, along with the application of the approach to a remote rural case study in Graubünden’s Lower Engadine and Val Müstair. Characteristics of pulse timetable networks and the wider rural network approach are considered, drawing broad lessons for their potential application elsewhere.},

These insights help to understand the impacts of {DRT} systems and support (future) design of {DRT} and public transport. A set of indicators was chosen for the intermodal comparison: travel distances, ridership, costs, Greenhouse Gases ({GHG}), emissions and population's perception. Ridership dropped from 78.1 passengers/day to 15.9 passengers/day, however, for being “demand-tailored”, passenger-km reduced even more, going from 1252.8 km/day to 136.6 km/day, hence reducing the costs and {GHG} emissions per passenger.

It adopts a ‘rural’ definition of settlements under a population of 10,000.Evidence from the National Travel Survey, technical press reports and academic work is brought together to examine the overall picture.Inter-urban services between towns can provide a cost-effective way of serving rural areas where smaller settlements are suitably located. The cost structures of both fixed-route and demand-responsive services indicate that staff time and cost associated with vehicle provision are the main elements. Demand-responsive services may enable larger areas to be covered, to meet planning objectives of ensuring a minimum of level of service, but experience often shows high unit cost and public expenditure per passenger trip. Economic evaluation indicates user benefits per passenger trip of similar magnitude to existing average public expenditure per trip on fixed-route services. Considerable scope exists for improvements to conventional services through better marketing and service reliability.The main issue in England is the level of funding for rural services in general, and the importance attached to serving those without access to cars in such areas.The boundary between fixed-route and demand-responsive operation may lie at relatively low population densities.The chapter uses statistical data, academic research and operator experience of enhanced conventional bus services to provide a synthesis of outcomes in rural areas.},

	abstract = {Public transport lines, especially train lines, have historically played an important role as economic lifelines of rural areas. They are one of the most important factors contributing to economic prosperity as they provide access to mobility for all the inhabitants of these regions. Maintaining such rural public transport lines can be a challenge due to the low utilization inherent to rural areas. Today, with the emergence of fully self-driving cars, on-demand mobility schemes in which autonomous robotic taxis transport passengers, are becoming possible. In this work, we analyze if rural public transport lines with low utilization can be replaced with autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. More specifically, we compare the existing public transportation infrastructure to hypothetical mobility-on-demand systems both in terms of cost and service level. We perform our analysis, which focuses on the operational aspects, using a simulation approach in which unit-capacity robotic taxis are operated in a street network taking into account congestion effects and state-of-the-art control (dispatching and rebalancing) strategies. Our study considers the case of four rural train lines in Switzerland that operate at low utilization and cost coverage. We show that a unit-capacity mobility-on-demand service with selfdriving cars reduces both travel times and operational cost in three out of four cases. In one case, even a service with human driven vehicles would provide higher service levels at lower cost. The results suggest that centrally coordinated mobility-on-demand schemes could be a very attractive option for rural areas.},

The obtained data was used to compute the performance measures, as well as to develop statistical models to estimate the average waiting time of buses at peak and off-peak hours. The results indicated that the waiting time at off-peak hours was two and a half times the waiting time at peak hours. It was found that 40\% of the external bus routes were within the range of overall Level of Service ({LOS}) C \& D, 26.67\% between B \& D, 13.33\% between B \& C, 13.33\% between C \& E and 6.67\% between D \& E. Also, it was found that 60\% of internal bus routes’ {LOSs} were between C \& D, 20\% between C \& E and 20\% with {LOS} C.

Traditionally, planning of rural feeder service has been carried out without due consideration to indirect costs associated with hard factors (e.g., walking distance and waiting time) and soft factors (e.g., crowding inside vehicles) of the service. A case study is presented for the planning of rural feeder service with due consideration to direct and indirect costs to users and operational viability of the service. Direct and indirect costs to users are expressed in terms of a comprehensive measure called generalized cost ({GC}). {GC} is developed on the basis of the willingness to pay ({WTP}) of rural commuters with respect to various attributes of rural feeder service. The work demonstrates the effect of catchment characteristics (i.e., number of villages, size of villages, and spatial separation represented by road network connecting villages to bus stop) on feeder service attributes (i.e., type of vehicle, route, headway of service and fare). It is also shown that planning of feeder service could be instrumental in bringing benefits to rural communities. The results presented in the paper are case specific, but the methodology can be applied to the planning of feeder services in other rural regions. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){TE}.1943-5436.0000419. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

An efficient public transportation system will contribute towards sustainable economic growth and healthy social development of the district, which, in turn, will ensure human security in respect of the mobility of goods and services for today’s and future needs. However, limited studies that analyse the service gap and local demand for the public bus service in Peninsular Malaysia have been conducted. The improvement in bus service reliability depends on several parameters including the route coverage and schedule. This study presents an empirical analysis of the fixed-route hour level of service ({LOS}) for urban and rural bus services to understand the level of reliability and quality of the service provided. A field survey was conducted to collect the secondary data concerning the bus routes and schedules from the local bus operators. Through a sampling survey of bus lines in selected urban and rural settlements in Peninsular Malaysia, service reliability based on the fixed-route hour service is evaluated. A total of nine (9) bus companies with a total of 48 routes were selected to represent nine (9) bus terminals operating in Johor, Penang, Pahang and Perak. Johor represents the southern states, while Penang represents the northern states. For the east-coast states, Pahang is selected, while Perak represents a still developing state, which is yet to reach the advanced level of large conurbations. The distance of a bus route from the origin to the destination is also analysed. A standard service quality measure is referred to in determining the level of service ({LOS}) and for identifying the service disparities between urban and rural settlements. The results indicate that the {LOS} for the fixed-route hour of bus services in the rural areas range from C to D and B to E in the urban settlement. The recommendations put forward include the improvement of real-time scheduling of buses, expansion of service hours and revised fare systems to ensure the future sustainability of the urban and rural bus services in Malaysia.},

The employment of internet of things ({IoT}) technologies has proven to be a valid response to mobility challenges in rural areas, and has brought up the concept of “smart land”. Framed within the context of the Interreg Central Europe project {RUMOBIL}, this study tries to shed light on how the deployment of smart mobility solutions within the rural context compare to that within the urban context. Following a literature review, we compared the ease of implementation of different {IoT} solutions on the urban and the rural contexts, for planners, travellers, and operators, and the relative complexity of common smart mobility issues. In addition, we identiﬁed three major challenges for both rural and urban mobility, namely the need for standardized metrics for optimal routes' detection and a dynamic deﬁnition of optimal route, as well as the simpliﬁcation of investments' planning and programming. Both smart cities and smart land can beneﬁt from smart mobility solutions, even if in most cases, each of the two contexts can gain more advantages than the other from the same solution. Even considering the different levels of population scattering, technological infrastructures, social maturity, and economic opportunities, both rural and urban areas offer comparable advantages. For the future of transport, it is up to all policy levels to consider the challenges deriving from expected trends and leverage the untapped potential of {IoT} technologies to satisfy future travellers’ needs and ensure sustainability.},

	abstract = {Public transport in rural areas is under pressure because demand is low and dispersed. To reduce costs, flexible and on-demand services are often proposed as alternatives for conventional bus services. Conventional services are generally not suitable for rural areas, because the demand is low and dispersed. In this paper, a stated preference survey is designed to identify the preferences of rural bus users for alternative services. Other than the traditional bus, two other modes are included in this study: a demand responsive transport ({DRT}) service and an express bus service with bike-sharing services for last mile transport. Given the on-demand nature of these alternatives, flexibility- and reliability-related attributes are included in the stated preference survey. The results from the choice model indicate that the reliability and flexibility aspects do not have a large effect on the preference for the on-demand alternatives. Instead, cost, access and egress times, and in-vehicle time play a bigger role in individuals? preferences toward the different alternatives. A sensitivity analysis shows that changes in the operational characteristics can make the on-demand alternatives more attractive. However, many bus users still prefer the conventional bus service over the on-demand alternatives.},

	abstract = {Transport can play a key role in mitigating climate change, through reducing traffic, emissions and dependency on private vehicles. Transport is also crucial to connect remote areas to central or urban areas. Yet, sustainable and flexible transport is among the greatest challenges for rural areas and rural–urban regions. Innovative transport concepts and approaches are urgently needed to foster sustainable and integrated regional development. This article addresses challenges of sustainability, accessibility, and connectivity through examining complementary systems to existing public transport, including demand-responsive transport and multimodal mobility. We draw upon case studies from the Metropolitan Area of Styria, Ljubljana Urban Region and rural Wales ({GUSTmobil}, {REGIOtim}, {EURBAN}, Bicikelj, Bwcabus, Grass Routes). In-depth analysis through a mixed-methods case study design captures the complexity behind these chosen examples, which form a basis for analysing the effects of services on accessibility for different groups, connectivity to public transport and usability as a “first and last mile” feeder. We further explore the weaknesses of complementary transport systems, including legal, organisational and financial barriers, and offer potential solutions to structure and communicate complementary transport systems to improve access and use. Looking ahead, we use the case studies to anticipate innovative, sustainable “mobility as a service” ({MaaS}) solutions within and between urban and rural areas and consider how future public policy orientations and arrangements can enable positive change. A main concern of our article and the contribution to scientific literature is through exploring the benefit of well-established multi-level governance arrangements when introducing smaller-scale mobility solutions to improve rural–urban accessibility. It becomes clear that not a one-size-fits-all model but placed-based and tailored approaches lead to successful and sustainable concepts.},

In Japan, rural areas face sparse populations and rapid growth in the percentage of elderly people. In these areas, many bus lines offer fewer than 10 services per day. In addition to low-frequency services, it is also inconvenient to transfer to another bus or train service. Thus, there is a strong need to design a timetable that ensures smooth transfers among buses and trains. We tackle this problem by adopting existing bus lines and train timetables as much as possible to avoid drastic changes such as an increase in the number of services. Based on this approach, we present a mathematical optimization model to generate a revised bus timetable that shortens waiting time for transfers compared with the current timetable. We apply our model to a part of the Tohoku District in Japan and demonstrate its usefulness in the real world.},

Little research has been done to develop frameworks for route design. A methodology to explore the most cost-effective {DFRT} route is presented in this paper. The inputs include potential {DFRT} demand distribution and a road network. A heuristic is used to build possible routes by starting at urban cores and extending in all network directions in certain length increments. All the {DFRT} routes falling in the length range desired by the users are selected. The cost effectiveness of those routes, defined by operating cost per passenger trip, is compared. The most cost-effective route is selected and presented in a {GIS} map. A case study illustrates the methodology in several Tennessee metropolitan regions. The most cost-effective route length is case specific; some routes (e.g. those out of our Nashville case) are most cost effective when short, while others (e.g. those out of Memphis) are most cost effective when long. Government agencies could use the method to identify routes with the lowest operating cost per passenger given a route length or an operating cost budget. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The transport demand in rural areas is often low, which makes it hard to establish and run a financially sustainable public transport system. A solution is integrated passenger transport that eliminates deficiencies and provides benefits for all participants in the public passenger transport process. This paper describes the impact of integrated passenger transport on mobility in rural areas and critically evaluates different literature sources. Integration of passenger transport in urban areas has been described in the context of rural areas, and the challenges of integration of public passenger transport specific to rural areas have been analysed. Through the application in urban and rural areas, the planning of integrated and non-integrated passenger transport has been functionally analysed. The analysis found an increase in the degree of mobility in the areas that use integrated passenger transport compared to the non-integrated one. This research of the literature review has identified the rural areas of mobility as under-researched. The mobility research can set up a more efficient passenger transport planning system in rural areas.},

	abstract = {Public transport in rural areas is currently often characterized by inadequate services, so that motorized private transport dominates these areas. This situation is considered to be unsatisfactory from an economic and social policy perspective, as it has considerable negative environmental effects. The main problems here are a decline in economic performance and an aging population as well as an increasing rural exodus. With the development of autonomously driving vehicles, it is now possible to achieve fundamental changes in the design of public transport services especially in terms of cost structures and attractiveness. However, this does not mean that the current structures of line-based service should be eliminated and completely replaced by new, quasi-individual forms of services. Rather, the objective is to extend the existing structures in order to significantly improve mobility provision through more flexibility and thus more attractiveness. The technical basics required for this exist or are already very advanced in the developments. In addition to the necessary vehicles, it is in particular the information and communication systems required for extensive interconnected network structures. However, to make the transformation successful, new organizational concepts and in particular a fundamental rethinking are required. It is not only the technical design of transport, but also to ensure the mobility needs of the population. The related developments and future tasks are outlined and discussed below.},

The organization of this paper follows the course of investigation: First, a literature review summarizes the state of discussion of alternative service concepts and financing, including subject-oriented subsidization schemes. In the next step, drivers of operating costs and revenues were formalized in a system of geographic zones in the context of a regional transport supply–demand model—complemented by bus operating costs as well as revenues vs. subsidies in the counties under investigation. The obtained as-is ranges of indicators relevant to the bus operators demonstrate the necessity to offset shrinking patronages in conjunction with adequate cost reductions. The case study results were used to substantiate predictions for the upcoming years under an operating environment scenario of 2025. Based on these findings, market research needs and policy recommendations, operationalized by five proposed implementation projects, were derived.},

If {DRT} vehicles are used to serve students, then the funding for conventional school buses (or adapted public transport schedules) can be reinvested in the {DRT} system. This may help to relieve the financial burden experienced by {DRT} operators and enable the operation of a large-scale {DRT} service in rural areas. In this study, a demand model for school commutes based on real-world, open-source data for Landkreis Vulkaneifel, a rural region in Germany, is built. Then a feasibility study is carried out using an agent-based transport simulation framework. In the feasibility study, various setups and operational schemes are explored, which are followed by a systematic cost analysis. Based on a conservative estimation, an annual budget of around 1600 Euro per student will be needed to maintain and operate a fleet of {DRT} vehicles that can transport all the students in the region from home to school on time in the morning. During the remaining time of the day and on school holidays, the vehicles can be used for conventional {DRT} service for the public.},

	abstract = {Rural areas generally have lower and more dispersed demands for travel which cannot sustain conventional public transport services and consequently have a greater number of flexible and demand responsive transport services operating. These services usually operate on a stand-alone basis, are often subsidized and are typically only accessible by certain passenger types or for specific trip purposes. This generally results in uncoordinated and inefficient transport provision overall. The Flexible integrated transport services ({FITS}) system featured in this paper has been designed to address this problem. {FITS} can be used as a planning tool to assess potential benefits from relaxing operating constraints (e.g., a service's operating boundaries), which can potentially suggest service redesign. It also includes the capacity to assign subsidy payments on a trip by trip basis to increase cost efficiency whilst meeting a greater proportion of transport needs. The case study in the paper focusses on transport to health in the Aberdeenshire and Morayshire areas of Scotland in the {UK}. Despite flexible transport operators receiving public funds to meet passenger needs, this is currently being supplemented by public bodies paying large amounts in taxi fares in instances where there is a statutory obligation to provide travel but where no other suitable transport service exists. The results demonstrate the potential substantial savings which could be realized by allowing transport operators to redesign their services by relaxing constraints and by the reassignment of subsidies: resulting in more passenger demands being met and a reduction in public spending on taxi fares.},

	abstract = {Geographic accessibility of health services is one of the key dimensions affecting health care access, utilisation and may impact population health. We analysed countrywide space-time accessibility to primary health services by private car and multimodal walk-ride-walk travel chains of public transport in Finland. The analysis utilises register-based population grid cell data at 250m × 250 m resolution, road network with scheduled public transport data and geocoded locations of four types of primary health service. Our results show that the Finnish population reaches primary health services well, also by public transport, which is most beneficial in urban fringes, where health services are not immediately available. However, accessibility of services may be limited for some segments of the population, such as carless households located in remote areas, and teenagers who access health services independently. Distinct regional differences exist in accessibility, particularly in rural areas. The continuous pressure to reduce the number of service facilities may further deter service accessibility of these segments of the population. As this kind of transport disadvantage may create or reinforce social disadvantage and exclusion, as well as health inequalities, ensuring an equal access to primary health services is important.},

This paper proposes a slack arrival strategy to reduce the number of rejected passengers and idle time at checkpoints resulting from uncertain travel demand. This strategy relaxes the departure time constraints of the checkpoints that do not function as transfer stations. A system cost function that includes the vehicle operation cost and customer cost is deﬁned to measure system performance. Theoretical and simulation models are constructed to test the beneﬁts of implementing the slack arrival strategy in ﬂex-route transit under expected and unexpected demand levels. Experiments over a real-life ﬂex-route transit service show that the proposed slack arrival strategy could improve the system performance by up to 40\% with no additional operating cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can help transit operators provide more cost-eﬃcient ﬂex-route transit services in suburban and rural areas.},

The passenger cost function is deﬁned as the performance measure of transit systems and the analytic work is performed based on a real-world ﬂag-stop transit service, in which we compare its system performance with another two comparable systems, the ﬁxed-route and ﬂex-route services, at expected and unexpected demand levels in order to be closer to reality. In addition, the dynamic-station policy is introduced to assist the ﬂex-route service to better deal with unexpectedly high demand. Experiments demonstrate the unique advantages of demi-ﬂexible operating policies in providing affordable, efﬁcient, and reliable transport service in low-demand operating environments and this work is helpful to optimize the unifying framework for designing public transit in suburban and rural areas.},

Regular public road transportation traditionally uses ﬁxed routes and schedules, which can be extremely expensive in rural areas and certain periods of the day in urban areas due to low and unpredictable demand. Demand Responsive Transportation systems are a kind of hybrid transportation approach between a taxi and a bus that try to address these problems with routes and frequencies that may vary according to the actual observed demand. Demand Responsive Transportation seems to have potential to answer the sustainability and social inclusion challenges in a context of austerity. However, {DRT} projects may fail: it is not only important to solve the underlying model in an efﬁcient way, but also to understand how different ways of operating the service affect customers and operators. To help design {DRT} services, we developed an innovative approach integrating simulation and optimization. Using this simulator, we compared a real night-time bus service in the city of Porto, Portugal, with a hypothetical ﬂexible {DRT} service for the same scenario.},

However, the market share of their pooled version (ridesharing, e.g., {UberPOOL} or {LyftLine}) is still low, despite its potential in addressing the mobility challenges that dense urban cities are facing. In this research, we analyse user preferences towards pooled on-demand services regarding their time-reliabilitycost trade-offs. We study, via stated preference experiments, the value of time ({VOT}) and value of reliability ({VOR}) of the different trip stages (waiting stage, in-vehicle stage, and transfer stage when combined with line-based public transport). We target urban Dutch individuals (N = 1006), and address commuting and leisure trips. Results show in-vehicle {VOT} for pooled on-demand services to amount to 7.88–10.80 €/h. These values are somewhat higher than known values of traditional public transport. We also find waiting {VOT} (both before the trip and during the transfer stage) to be lower than values previously reported in literature. In general, we find {VOR} to be lower than {VOT}: the reliability ratio ({VOR}/{VOT} ratio) for both the waiting stage and the in-vehicle stage being around 0.5. In order to understand different preferences, we also estimate latent class choice models. The analysis shows that the main difference between classes pertains to the overall time-cost and reliability-cost trade-offs ({VOT} and {VOR} values) rather than in different valuations of the reliability ratio. In addition to serving as input for demand forecasting models such as macroscopic static assignment and agent-based simulation models, our findings can support service providers in developing their strategy when designing pooled ondemand services.},

	abstract = {On-demand multi-passenger shared transport options are increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to reduce traffic congestion and emissions and improve the convenience and travel experience for passengers. These services, often referred to as on-demand public transport, are aimed at meeting personal travel demands through the use of shared vehicles that run on flexible routes using advanced tools for dynamic scheduling. This paper presents an agent-based traffic simulation model that was developed to evaluate the performance of on-demand public transport and compare it with existing scheduled bus services using a case study of the inner city of Melbourne in Australia. The key performance measures used in the comparative evaluation included quality of service and passenger experience in terms of waiting times, the efficiency of service and operations in terms of hourly vehicle utilization, and system efficiency in terms of trip completion rates, passenger kilometers travelled and total passenger trip times. The results showed significant benefits for passengers who use on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services. The on-demand bus service was found to reduce average total passenger waiting times by 89\% during the Morning Peak; by 78\% during the Mid-Day period; by 81\% during the Afternoon Peak; and by more than 95\% during other periods of the day. From an operator’s perspective, the on-demand services were found to achieve around 70\% vehicle utilization rates during peak hours compared to a utilization rate not exceeding 16\% for the scheduled bus services. Even during off-peak periods, the occupancies for on-demand services were almost twice the vehicle occupancies for scheduled bus services. In terms of system efficiency, the on-demand services achieved a trip completion rate of 85\% compared to a trip completion rate of 67\% for the scheduled bus services. The total passenger-kilometers travelled was similar for both scheduled and on-demand bus services, which refutes claims that on-demand bus services induce more kilometers of travel. The trip completion times were around 55\% shorter for on-demand bus services compared to scheduled services, which represents a significant saving in travel time for users. Finally, the paper presents average emissions per completed trip for both types of services and shows a significant reduction in emissions for on-demand services compared to conventional bus services. These include, on average, a 48\% reduction in {CO}2 emissions per trip; 82\% reduction in {NO} emissions per trip; and 41\% reduction in p.m.10 emissions per trip. These findings clearly demonstrate the superior benefits of on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services.},

We conducted two computer simulations of dial-a-ride and fixed-route systems in order to compare the usability and profitability of both systems. Simulation results indicated that: (1) The usability of the dial-a-ride system with a fixed number of buses drops very quickly when the number of requests(demands) increases. (2) When we increase the number of buses proportionally to the number of demand, the usability of the dial-a-ride system is improved more significantly than that of the fixed-route system. (3) When frequency of demands is sufficiently, the dial-a-ride system is a reasonable solution from the both usability and profitability perspectives.},

This paper considers the integration of autonomous vehicles into bus transit systems and proposes a modeling framework to determine the optimal bus fleet size and its assignment onto multiple bus lines in a bus service network considering uncertain demand. The mixed-integer stochastic programming approach is applied to formulate the problem. We apply the sample average approximation ({SAA}) method to solve the formulated stochastic programming problem. To tackle the nonconvexity of the {SAA} problem, we first present a reformulation method that transforms the problem into a mixed-integer conic quadratic program ({MICQP}), which can be solved to its global optimal solution by using some existing solution methods. However, this {MICQP} based approach can only handle the small-size problems. For the cases with large problem size, we apply the approach of quadratic transform with linear alternating algorithm, which allows for efficient solution to large-scale instances with up to thousands of scenarios in a reasonable computational time. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of introducing autonomous buses as they are flexible to be assigned across different bus service lines, especially when demand uncertainty is more significant. The introduction of autonomous buses would enable further reduction of the required fleets and total cost. The model formulation and solution methods proposed in this study can be used to provide bus transit operators with operational guidance on including autonomous buses into bus services, especially on the autonomous and conventional bus fleets composition and allocation.},

	abstract = {Electric buses (e-buses) are increasingly adopted in the transit systems for their benefits of reduced roadside pollution and better onboard experience. E-bus scheduling is a critical problem in the operation planning stage of transit management to ensure efficient and reliable transit service. In Chinese mega cities, the e-bus networks are operated with many bus routes characterized by high service frequency and long operation time, making the e-bus scheduling a large-scale problem. Besides, the transit agency requires the vehicle-depot constraint to limit the e-bus reposition since it is not cost-efficient. An efficient method to generate optimized schedules that meet the above requirements is desired by the transit agencies. In this paper, we address a large-scale multi-depot electric bus scheduling problem considering the vehicle-depot constraint and partial recharging policy. A mixed integer programming model and an efficient branch-and-price ({BP}) algorithm are developed to solve the problem. In the {BP} algorithm, we devise a heuristic method to generate good initial solutions and adopted heuristic decisions in the label setting algorithm to solve the pricing problem. In this way, the efficiency of the {BP} algorithm is achieved and the large-sized problem instances can be solved. We conduct extensive numerical experiments based on the fixed-route and multi-route operation cases in Shenzhen. The results show that the {BP} algorithm can generate provable high-quality solutions. Sensitivity analysis indicates that increasing battery capacity and charging rate can reduce the operational cost. The optimal charging schedules can also provide guide in determining the capacity of the charging facilities.},

	title = {Contram. Structure of the model},
	abstract = {{CONTRAM} is a traffic assignment model developed by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory for use in the design of traffic management schemes in urban areas. Given the traffic demands between origins and destinations for a network it predicts routes of vehicles and flows and queues on links. It is a capacity restrained model which takes account of the interactive effects of traffic between junctions over a network and the variation through time of traffic conditions-in particular it models the build up and decay of congestion such as occurs during peak periods. An iterative procedure is used to assign vehicles to their minimum journey time routes through a network taking into account the delay at each junction along a route at the time that a vehicle reaches each junction. The assignment procedure, which uses a packet structure to represent elements of flow of vehicles for movements between Origins and Destinations, allows multi-routeing for vehicles with freedom of choice of route; fixed route vehicles, such as buses, are sent along their predefined routes, but still encounter the same delays at junctions experienced by other vehicles. The modelling in {CONTRAM} is consistent with the queue calculations in {ARCADY}, {PICADY} and {OSCADY}.},

After the metro construction, it is faced with the problem of how to adjust and optimize the original bus lines based on the new metro system. This research mainly proposes a bus line optimization method based on bus and metro integration. In the consideration of the geographical space, the cooperation and competition relationship between bus and metro lines is qualitatively introduced according to the geographical location and service range of metro (800 m radius) and bus (500 m radius) stations. The competition and cooperation indexes are applied to define the co-opetition relationship between bus and metro lines. The bus line optimization model is constructed based on the co-opetition coefficient and Changsha Metro Line Number 2 is chosen as a case study to verify the optimization model. The results show that the positive competition, efficient cooperation, and travel efficiency between metro and bus has been significantly enhanced after optimization. Moreover, this paper provides a reasonable reference for public transport network planning and resource allocation.},

However, these new modes (e.g., ride-hailing and ridesharing) are not always more sustainable than traditional modes, such as public transport networks. In this work, we propose a dynamic transit bus system that aims at combining the higher convenience provided to passengers in on-demand systems with the sustainability of public transport. The goal is to attract more passengers to the transit service by offering reduced walk-to-station distance and total travel time compared to the fixed lines. Our proposed system plans the routes and intermediate stops of the transit lines based on the actual observed demand. Due to the complexity of the resulting optimization problem under investigation, we propose a solution method which splits the problem into four stages: clustering, initialization, optimization, and merging. We compare our proposed system in two settings: flexible (i.e., all intermediate stations are dynamic), and semi-flexible (i.e., original fixed lines intermediate stations are kept at the route and more dynamic stations are added) to the fixed static line. Our results show that our proposed system offers a more sustainable option and can reduce the system-wide travel distance by attracting more on-demand passengers to the transit service by offering them reduced walking distance and travel duration compared to the static lines. We also quantify the positive impact of passengers’ willingness to act more sustainably by accepting to walk more or arrive later to their destinations on the system-wide sustainability.},

In this work a multi-objective optimization and multi-agent simulation framework is developed to study potential changes in the network design and frequency settings compared to conventional {PT} systems when autonomous vehicles ({AV}) systems are deployed on fixed-route networks. During the optimization process multiple deployment scenarios (network configurations and service frequency) are evaluated and optimized considering the operator cost, user cost and infrastructure preparation costs of the system. User-focused network design and operator-focused network design are studied for a real-world urban area in Sweden. The results provide insights into the network design and level of service implications brought about by the deployment of autonomous bus ({AB}) when those are integrated in route-based {PT} systems. We show that the deployment of autonomous buses result with a network design that increases service ridership.

One of the main strategies that is employed to deal with rail service interruptions is “bus bridging,” whereby buses from scheduled services are deployed to offer shuttle services. Very few efforts are found in the literature that have investigated this policy’s effectiveness. Therefore, this study aims at exploring the different aspects and impacts of retracting buses from scheduled services in response to subway and streetcar service interruptions in Toronto. It explores the size of the deployment, as well as the system response and recovery times using detailed subway and streetcar shuttle service reports collected in 2015.

We devise an optimization framework and show how it can be solved using genetic algorithms in order to handle dynamic demands for passenger transport/products, uncertain supply delays, and variations in product availability. Performance evaluations with extensive simulations show that flexibly deciding the {AEV} routes improves the transportation efficiency by 24-78\% whereas improves the delivery quality by 2 times compared to the typical fixed routes/schedules used both by regular passenger bus services and by local distribution operations.},

	abstract = {Ridesharing revolutionizes feeder services by seamlessly connecting dispersed passengers to common destinations, such as train stations, bus terminals, airports, special event locations, and post-disaster shelters. This paper develops real-time re-optimization methodologies for generalized dynamic ridesharing feeder service operation. Such ridesharing feeder service typically encompasses a mix of scheduled and on-demand service, in which riders can schedule the request early in advance or send on-demand request for immediate service, and both types of riders are possible to share the ride. The developed methodologies enable the system to continuously re-optimize and re-adjust the vehicle routing plan that achieves the primary objective of maximizing the total number of served riders and the secondary objective of minimizing the total vehicle miles or hours traveled, simultaneously accounting for mixed types of riders' mobility requirements. This paper develops a re-optimization model implemented by a rolling horizon planning approach. An efficient heuristic algorithm, namely Large Neighborhood Search by Tabu Search algorithm ({LNS}-{TS}), is developed to solve large-scale problems. To validate the methodology, a simulation is developed to model rider activity, as well as the ridesharing process. This paper presents two case studies in Houston, Texas: a first-mile ridesharing service improving transit connectivity and a post-disaster cooling shelter access service addressing emergency transport under extreme heat. These cases represent two distinct operational contexts—everyday urban mobility and emergency disaster response—demonstrating the model's adaptability across diverse scenarios. The results generated by the re-optimization methodologies are compared with those from a periodic optimization approach, where matching and routing optimizations are conducted in isolation at different time intervals. The simulation results demonstrate that the routing plan obtained by the real-time re-optimization methodologies can serve more riders and save more vehicle miles or hours traveled compared with the periodic optimization methods. The proposed real-time, dynamic re-optimization approach for ridesharing feeder services not only demonstrates practical benefits but also holds promise for applications in autonomous vehicle systems.},

	abstract = {Urban transit systems usually operate according to fixed-route and fixed-schedule schemes by employing fixed-capacity vehicles, despite the mobility demand is unevenly spread out in both space and time. Modular buses are an emerging technology in which modules of relatively small capacity can be dynamically docked together to form greater capacity buses and can, therefore, make the transit system capable of adapting the capacity to the actual mobility demand. A module can be shifted from one line to another at pre-defined intersections and can be relocated when empty, if beneficial. We call these two operations sharing and rebalancing, respectively. Given a transit network comprising multiple bus lines and a mobility demand, we present an integer linear program to determine an optimal assignment of modules to lines, so that the mobility demand is met with a minimum total number of modules. Computational experiments show that, by exploiting the flexibility of modular buses, the total capacity deployed can be reduced by 49\% with respect to a conventional transit system, whereas the average occupancy ratio increases from 41.22\% to 72.85\%.},

By integrating the cost efficiency of fixed-route transit system and the flexibility of demand responsive transit system, the proposed model is capable of letting operating feeder busses temporarily deviate from their current route so as to serve the reported demand locations. With an objective of minimizing total bus travel time, a new operational mode is then proposed to allow busses to serve passengers on both street sides. In addition, when multiple feeder busses are operating in the target service area, the proposed model can provide an optimal plan to locate the nearest one to response to the demands. A three-stage solution algorithm is also developed to yield meta-optimal solutions to the problem in a reasonable amount of time by transforming the problem into a traveling salesman problem.

When the feeder service region is sufficiently large, the spatial heterogeneity in demand distribution must be considered. This paper develops continuum approximation models for optimizing a heterogeneous fixed-route feeder network in a rectangular service region next to a rail terminal. Our work enhances previous studies by: (i) optimizing heterogeneous stop spacings along with line spacings and headways; (ii) accounting for passenger boarding and alighting numbers on bus dwell times and patron transfer delays at the rail terminal; and (iii) examining the advantages of asymmetric coordination between trunk and feeder schedules in both service directions. To tackle the increased modeling complexity, we introduce a semi-analytical method that combines analytically derived properties of the optimal solution with an iterative search algorithm. Local transit agencies can readily utilize this approach to design a real fixed-route feeder system.},

Traditional dial-a-ride services have often been criticised because of their relatively high cost of provision, their lack of ﬂexibility in route planning and their inability to manage high demand. The potential for overcoming these limitations may be realised through the introduction of telematics-based {DRT} and this has been widely demonstrated, for example, in recent research funded by the European Commission (e.g. the {DGXIII}-funded {SAMPO} and {SAMPLUS} projects). This paper provides an introduction to the concept of telematics-based {DRT} services and presents the results of the evaluation of a set of {DRT} technologies and operations at urban and rural sites across Europe.

Drawing on the experience of a number of {UK} schemes, the paper assesses the reasons for the new-found success of what is becoming a relatively well-accepted mode by concentrating on a variety of factors including: service characteristics (particularly route ﬂexibility, ﬂexibility of booking method and pre-booking regime), emerging markets and the overall contribution of {DRT} to increased social inclusion and intermodality. Impediments to the development of {DRT} services are highlighted. The paper also discusses current research into the next generation of {DRT} services and concludes by identifying some key issues for policy-makers concerned with the future implementation of {DRT} services.},

This paper presents an alternative ﬂexible-route transit system, in which each bus is allowed to travel across a predetermined area to serve passengers, while these bus service areas collectively form a hybrid ‘‘grand’’ structure that resembles huband-spoke and grid networks. We analyze the agency and user cost components of this proposed system in idealized square cities and seek the optimum network layout, service area of each bus, and bus headway, to minimize the total system cost. We compare the performance of the proposed transit system with those of comparable systems (e.g., ﬁxedroute transit network and taxi service), and show how each system is advantageous under certain passenger demand levels. It is found out that under low-to-moderate demand levels, the proposed ﬂexible-route system tends to have the lowest system cost.},

We then compare the performance of the proposed transit system with that of fixed-route transit service and show the pros and cons of each system for several passenger demand levels. It is found that at low-to-moderate demand levels, the proposed flexible-route system tends to provide the lowest total travel time. In comparing a real-world deployment of the system in Guangzhou with comparable alternative system states, the optimization of the former is evident in idle and tidal modes, in which the total travel times reduced by more than 10\%.

	abstract = {The purpose of this work is to review urban transportation likely to be offered in the future. Trip-making behaviour has already changed considerably as lifestyles change and they will continue to change in the future. This work reflects and places emphasis on profound thinking about the possibilities, rather than predicting them. Thoughts about possibilities for the future draw upon imagination, perceived and justified feasibility, and lessons gained from the past. This work attempts to capture the possibilities, logistics and travel modes of future urban transportation. A visionary, feasibility-related approach grounded in a realist perspective is proposed, only conceptually, to explore plausible visions for the future. In addition, this work shows the inefficiency of using private cars ({PCs}) and argues that in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, {PCs} cannot provide a solution competitive with the potential that urban transportation systems have for the future. Hence, the solutions for the future must be based on public transport ({PT}) modes of travel, regardless of whether they are metro, bus, light rail, tram, ridesharing services, an ordinary taxi, personal rapid transit, or any other {PT}-based future mode. The key principal of operation for the mobility of a smart city will be the ability to optimize the connectivity of movement in order to approach a seamless move, while endowing the phrase door-to-door travel with new meaning. Finally, it would be remiss not to mention the unforeseeable implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for future mobility, more controllable by automation of non-privately owned vehicle, and with the prospect of people demonstrating a greater inclination towards changing their habits, behaviour, and thinking paradigms.},

An understanding of service reliability is necessary to develop strategies that help transit agencies provide better services. However, few studies have been conducted analyzing bus reliability in the metropolis of China. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of service reliability based on bus operational characteristics in Beijing. Three performance parameters, punctuality index based on routes ({PIR}), deviation index based on stops ({DIS}), and evenness index based on stops ({EIS}), are proposed for the evaluation of bus service reliability. Reliability involves routes, stops, punctuality, deviation, and evenness. The relationship among the three parameters is discussed using a numerical example. Subsequently, through a sampling survey of bus lines in Beijing, service reliability at the stop, route, and network levels are estimated. The effects of route length, headway, the distance from the stop to the origin terminal, and the use of exclusive bus lanes are also analyzed. The results indicate low service reliability for buses in Beijing and a high correlation between service reliability and route length, headway, distance from the stop to the origin terminal, and the provision of exclusive bus lanes.},

Finally, by adopting a specific coding scheme, an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-{II} ({NSGA}-{II}) is designed to quickly search Pareto optimal solutions. Furthermore, an experiment is conducted in Beijing city from one bus line to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Various options for increasing the share of environmentally friendly transport through electric buses and trolleybuses are considered, and an assessment and a comparative analysis of the options are given. Features of planning the work of drivers, drawing up the schedule, and considering safety requirements are considered.Intensive growth in the level of motorization of the population, an increase in the number of business trips, the use of light vehicles with small volumes of freight, and the emergence of "commercial" routes have led in recent years to a sharp increase in car flows in urban transport systems. In this regard, a whole range of tasks arises related to increasing the comfort of movement and the quality of life of citizens in general, which is possible by optimizing the operation of route (urban) passenger transport and increasing its attractiveness for users of all levels. Experimental and computational-theoretical studies were carried out to improve the work of route passenger (urban) transport of cities (in the example of Polotsk and Novopolotsk). Recommendations are given for further improving the operation of urban passenger transport systems according to alternative scenarios for the cities of Polotsk and Novopolotsk. An assessment is made of the possibility of achieving planned indicators for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from implementing the pilot project measures to improve the quality and efficiency of the route passenger transport in these cities. A comparative analysis of the possibility of developing various electric route passenger transport types is carried out. A map has been developed for reducing emissions of pollutants from vehicles with a change in the population’s mobility structure, an increase in the share of use of route passenger transport, and an increase in the speed of movement of route passenger transport.A methodology for assessing the efficiency of urban passenger transport has been developed, including taking into account the development of electric vehicles, which made it possible to determine the need to purchase appropriate vehicles for organizing the movement of non-rail electric vehicles, create a base for their repair and maintenance; construction of traction substations (new or additional); construction of cable networks; train staff. Also, an algorithm has been developed to implement the least costly activities with limited funding at the initial stage. The studies allowed us to formulate a concept and propose specific comprehensive measures to improve the quality and efficiency of the route passenger transport in Polotsk and Novopolotsk, including optimizing the existing route network of route passenger transport.Studies of the effectiveness of measures aimed at reducing delays in route passenger transport have been carried out, and criteria and places of their application in Polotsk and Novopolotsk have been determined, as well as an assessment of the technical and economic indicators of the proposed options using the international {CBA} methodology (Cost Benefit Analysis).A business model has been developed to implement standard measures to improve the quality and efficiency of the route passenger transport and increase urban passenger transport’s attractiveness and efficiency.},

	abstract = {In urban settings, bus transit stands as a significant mode of public transportation, yet faces hurdles in delivering accurate and reliable arrival times. This discrepancy often culminates in delays and a decline in ridership, particularly in areas with a heavy reliance on bus transit. A prevalent challenge is the mismatch between actual bus arrival times and their scheduled counterparts, leading to disruptions in fixed schedules. Our study, utilizing New York City bus data, reveals an average delay of approximately eight minutes between scheduled and actual bus arrival times. This research introduces an innovative, {AI}-based, data-driven methodology for predicting bus arrival times at various transit points (stations), offering a collective prediction for all bus lines within large metropolitan areas. Through the deployment of a fully connected neural network, our method elevates the accuracy and efficiency of public bus transit systems. Our comprehensive evaluation encompasses over 200 bus lines and 2 million data points, showcasing an error margin of under 40 seconds for arrival time estimates. Additionally, the inference time for each data point in the validation set is recorded at below 0.006 ms, demonstrating the potential of our Neural-Net-based approach in substantially enhancing the punctuality and reliability of bus transit systems.},

To enhance urban mobility, much research was invested in traveling time prediction: given an origin and destination, provide a passenger with an accurate estimation of how long a journey lasts. In this work, we investigate a novel combination of methods from Queueing Theory and Machine Learning in the prediction process. We propose a prediction engine that, given a scheduled bus journey (route) and a ‘source/destination’ pair, provides an estimate for the traveling time, while considering both historical data and real-time streams of information that are transmitted by buses. We propose a model that uses natural segmentation of the data according to bus stops and a set of predictors, some use learning while others are learning-free, to compute traveling time. Our empirical evaluation, using bus data that comes from the bus network in the city of Dublin, demonstrates that the snapshot principle, taken from Queueing Theory, works well yet suffers from outliers. To overcome the outliers problem, we use Machine Learning techniques as a regulator that assists in identifying outliers and propose prediction based on historical data.},

However, this can generate overcrowded routes at certain times and low economic efficiency for public urban transport companies when buses carry few passengers. This article proposes a Public Urban Transport Scheduling System ({PUTSS}) algorithm for allocating a public urban transport fleet based on the number of passengers waiting for a bus and considering the efficiency of public urban transport companies. The {PUTSS} algorithm integrates artificial intelligence ({AI}) methods to identify the number of people waiting at each station through real-time image acquisition. The technique presented is Azure Computer Vision. In a case study, the accuracy of correctly identifying the number of persons in an image was computed using the Microsoft Azure Computer Vision service. The proposed {PUTSS} algorithm also uses Google Maps Service for congestion-level identification. Employing these modern tools in the algorithm makes improving public urban transport services possible. The algorithm is integrated into a software application developed in C\#, simulating a real-world scenario involving two public urban transport vehicles. The global accuracy rate of 89.81\% demonstrates the practical applicability of the software product.},

This study examines the potential performance of an Automated Demand Responsive Transport Service ({ADRTS}) as a replacement for scheduled bus services and simulates the effects of demand levels, vehicle capacity, vehicle dwell time and the initial vehicle distribution on system performance in terms of fleet size and system costs. The simulation tool allows simulating the operation of the {ADRTS} in a complete graph and is applied to the case study of Arnhem, the Netherlands. For this case study it has been shown that for a minimum fleet size following the imposed constraints, the operational costs range between 0.84 and 1.22 Euros and the average passenger wait time ranges between 2 and 6 min, according to the assumptions made on demand and operational parameters. The operational costs of the {ADRTS} showed to be in the same range of the current bus system, while providing a demand-responsive transport service with an average waiting time of around 4 min per passenger-trip. The economies of scale, which play an important role in public transport, are also apparent in the simulated {ADRTS} operations.},

	shorttitle = {Mobility and the Sharing Economy},
	abstract = {Shared mobility – the shared use of a motor vehicle, bicycle, or other mode – enables travellers to gain short-term access to transportation modes on an as-needed basis. The term 'shared mobility' includes the modes of carsharing, personal vehicle sharing (peer-to-peer carsharing and fractional ownership), bikesharing, scooter sharing, traditional ridesharing, transportation network companies (or ridesourcing), and e-Hail (taxis). It can also include flexible transit services, including microtransit, which supplement fixed-route bus and rail services. Shared mobility has proliferated in global cities not only as an innovative transportation mode enhancing urban mobility but also as a potential solution to address first- and last-mile connectivity with public transit. It can extend the catchment area of public transportation, potentially playing a pivotal role in bridging gaps in the existing transportation network and encouraging multimodality for first- and last-mile trips rather than driving alone. While public transit is often constrained by fixed routes, driver availability, and vehicle scheduling, shared mobility's 'on-demand' access provides the flexibility that travellers need to access or egress from a bus or rail 'trunk line'. Moreover, shared mobility provides an alternative to costly feeder bus services and land-intensive parking infrastructure. This paper discusses the history of shared mobility within the context of the urban transportation landscape, first in Europe and Asia, and more recently in the Americas, with a specific focus on first- and last-mile connections to public transit. The authors discuss the known impacts of shared mobility modes -carsharing, bikesharing, and ridesourcing – on reducing vehiclemiles/vehicle-kilometres travelled ({VMT}/{VKT}), greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions, and modal splits with public transit. The future of shared mobility in the urban transportation landscape is discussed, as mobile technology and public policy continue to evolve to integrate shared mobility with public transit and future automated vehicles.},

Envisioning an integrated system in the context of the ﬁrst-mile problem during morning peak hours, we propose to preserve high demand bus routes while repurposing low-demand bus routes and using shared {AVs} as an alternative. An agent-based supply-side simulation is built to assess the performance of the proposed service in ﬁfty-two scenarios with diﬀerent ﬂeet sizes and ridesharing preferences. Under a set of assumptions on {AV} operation costs and dispatching algorithms, the results show that the integrated system has the potential of enhancing service quality, occupying fewer road resources, being ﬁnancially sustainable, and utilizing bus services more eﬃciently.},

At low demand densities ﬂexible bus service has lower average costs and provides convenient door-to-door service. Bus size and operation type are related since larger buses have lower average cost per passenger at higher demand densities. The operation type and other decisions are jointly optimized here for a bus transit system connecting a major terminal to local regions. Conventional and ﬂexible bus sizes, conventional bus route spacings, areas of service zones for ﬂexible buses, headways, and ﬂeet sizes are jointly optimized in multi-dimensional nonlinear mixed integer optimization problems. To solve them, we propose a hybrid approach, which combines analytic optimization with a Genetic Algorithm. Numerical analysis conﬁrms that the proposed method provides near-optimal solutions and shows how the proposed Mixed Fleet Variable Type Bus Operation ({MFV}) can reduce total cost compared to alternative operations such as Single Fleet Conventional Bus ({SFC}), Single Fleet Flexible Bus ({SFF}), Mixed Fleet Conventional Bus ({MFC}) and Mixed Fleet Flexible Bus ({MFF}). With consistent system-wide bus sizes, capital costs are reduced by sharing ﬂeets over times and over regions. The sensitivity of results to several important parameters is also explored.},

	abstract = {Providing public transport in areas of low demand has long proved to be a challenge to policy makers and practitioners. With the developing economic, social and environmental trends, there is pressure for alternative solutions to the policy of subsidising conventional bus services. One potential solution is to adopt more flexible routes and/or timetables to better match the required demand. Therefore such ‘on demand’ or ‘Demand Responsive Transport’ ({DRT}) services (known as paratransit in the {US}) have been adopted in a number of locations. This paper seeks to explore the effects of area-wide factors on the demand of {DRT} by reporting the results of a statistical analysis of {DRT} service provision in the metropolitan region of Greater Manchester, the public transport authority of which offers one of the largest and most diverse range of {DRT} schemes in the {UK}. Specifically, this paper employs a multilevel modelling approach to investigate the impact of both {DRT} supply-oriented factors at the service area level and socio-economic factors at the lower super output area ({LSOA}) level on the average number of trips made by {DRT} per year. This hierarchical or ‘nested’ structure was adopted because typically the {LSOAs} within the same Service Area may share similar characteristics. It is found that the demand for {DRT} services was higher in areas with low car ownership, low population density, high proportion of white people, and high levels of social deprivation, measured in terms of income, employment, education, housing and services, health and disability, and living environment.},

	abstract = {Feeder services are public transit services that transport people from a low demand, typically suburban, area to a high demand area, such as a transportation hub or a city. Here, passengers continue their journey using traditional forms of public transport. On the one hand, on-demand feeder services have been a topic of discussion in a number of recent studies, since these services can serve the demand efficiently. On the other hand, traditional feeder services with predetermined routes and timetables provide predictability and easier cost control. In this paper, a demand-responsive feeder service is considered, which combines positive characteristics of both traditional services as well as on-demand-only services. This feeder service has mandatory bus stops which are always serviced, as well as optional bus stops which are only serviced when there is demand for transportation nearby. To optimize the performance of this feeder service, a large neighborhood search heuristic is developed. Experimental results on 14 benchmark instances illustrate that the {LNS} algorithm obtains solutions with an average gap of 1\% or less compared to the optimal solution, within 1s of runtime. Larger instances can also be solved, typically in less than 60s. The results also show that the demand-responsive feeder service generally outperforms a traditional service in terms of service quality, often by more than 60\%.},

Since bus systems with ﬂexible demand-responsive routes retain the economic and environmental advantages of public transportation, it is important to analyze them and optimize their characteristics to match their operating environments. This study shows how the total cost can be minimized for a ﬂexible-route bus system with a many-to-one demand pattern by jointly optimizing its headway and service zone size.

This simulation study explores the potential of replacing conventional bus lines with shared autonomous vehicles in a suburban area of Berlin. Several scenarios with diﬀerent ﬂeet sizes and vehicle sizes are simulated using the multi agent transport simulation {MATSim}. The simulation suggests for all evaluated scenarios higher operating costs and only slight travel time savings in comparison to conventional buses. Door-to-door service allows for signiﬁcant reductions in average walk time, but causes numerous detours which consume a high share of the time gained.

We set up the {DRT} service in such a way that its service quality (in terms of waiting time and in-vehicle time) is comparable to the replaced buses. The results show that a {DRT} service can be more cost efficient than regular buses and can produce significantly less {CO}2 emissions when the demand level is low. Additionally, we analyse the demand density at which regular buses become more cost efficient and explore how the target service quality of a {DRT} service can affect operational characteristics.

	abstract = {The provision of public transit services is essential to provide citizens with an improved quality of life. The most popular fixed route bus service ({FRBS}) is intended to serve a large population along with fixed stops, routes, and schedules. However, in low demand conditions, bus transit operators pay a high cost per passenger to maintain the desired level of service. A demand-responsive transit ({DRT}) is a commonly discussed transportation solution for serving low passenger demand. Although the conventional {DRT} system offers a shared-ride door-to-door service to passengers, its implementation is challenging and expensive during peak hours. The present study suggests a form of transit system that combines the rigidity of {FRBS} and flexibility of {DRT} to operate in low demand routes. This defined category of transit service is referred to as semi-flexible transit ({SFT}) system. The proposed {SFT} service is delivered along the fixed bus route and a limited number of fixed stops based on a flexible schedule to meet passenger requests. The defined {SFT} system offers reduced operating time and higher vehicle utilization. The study considers an operation of the proposed {SFT} service for two types of service delivery systems: Contract-Out Taxi Service ({COTS}), and In-House Paratransit Service ({IHPS}). A methodology is proposed to develop analytical models describing operational costs of regular {FRBS}, {COTS}, and {IHPS} as a function of demand or annual ridership. Operating cost models are proposed as a decision support tool to enable transit planners to determine the passenger demands along the route at which it is justifiable to “switch” from {FRBS} to the {SFT} system to minimize the total cost of operation. Further, the analysis results for {FRBS} indicate that operating costs are strongly related to vehicle-service hours and for {SFT} services to average vehicle occupancy rate and deadheading time. Applications of the proposed models and analysis method are demonstrated for a low demand route in the City of Regina.},

A compact set of estimations of the user performance and operating cost is provided, based on geometric probability. The optimization procedure allows the cost comparison of different semi-flexible services. Transit systems operated by cars (shared taxicabs) with flexible layouts are preferable for low demand densities (less than 92 pax/km2-h). For very high demand (higher than 200 pax/km2-h), bus systems with fixed layout and variable stop locations present the lowest total cost per passenger. In an intermediate domain, taxi and semi-flexible services compete among each other. The estimation of unit operating costs allows decision-makers to calculate the subsidies needed to make the system profitable.},

This paper examines whether people who show characteristics that indicate a mobility deficit are more willing to access the {DRT} system {EcoBus} in a rural area of Germany. Using survey data from 156 respondents from households in the {EcoBus} service area and utilizing linear regression analysis, this study confirms that car availability harms the intended use of {DRT} and that physical impairment has a positive effect, as identified several times in the literature. Furthermore, the influence of age on the intended {EcoBus} use depends on the residence place’s city size and hence on its offer of daily public services. While residents of a sub-centre of the region are significantly less willing to use the {EcoBus} with increasing age, there is an opposite tendency for small villages. Thus, in small inaccessible localities, the likelihood of using {EcoBus} increases with age, suggesting that {DRT} systems benefit the doubly constrained population, namely the elderly population in localities with few public services.},

Besides the requirements large cities and urban areas have towards mobility, also suburban or even rural areas expect great improvements from this technology in order to sustain or even increase their attractiveness for their populations. Challenges such as restricted availability and access to public transport could be overcome with the help of autonomous vehicles. These promise to be able to provide on demand mobility services for the various interest groups which could go beyond the service of regular bus lines with predefined bus stops. But in order to become successful the new developments should meet the requirements and expectations the inhabitants of rural areas have and express. This paper focuses on these requirements through an empirical study in the town of Buechenbronn located in the suburban area of the city of Pforzheim, Germany.

The basis of current public transport is a fix network of both infrastructure and services, presenting a high lack of flexibility, especially regarding geographical issues. Traditional and innovative on-demand transport services, such as taxi and carsharing respectively, can provide the level of flexibility to the public transport needed to provide both a better service while reducing the exploitation costs. In this context, the study aims to improve the efficiency of on-demand transport systems, mainly taxi and carsharing through the development of analytical models and their application to the city of Barcelona. The optimization of the fleet management and the allocation of resources aim to ensure both the level of service of public transport users and the agency’s profitability. The decision variables are the fleet size (number of vehicles) as well as the number and capacity of the depots or stands. Two models are presented, one for the provision of taxi stand service and one for the provision of one way carsharing service. Both models are applied to the demand for taxi services of the city of Barcelona, presenting for each model the optimum number of vehicles and depots, the depots’ capacity, the system unitary costs and the level of service. Although the results show that the performance of both systems is very similar, the taxi service is up to three times more expensive due to the extra cost from the need for having a driver.},

However, challenges persist, including societal acceptance, operational and traffic integration, and regulatory frameworks. This study addresses these barriers through a systematic literature review using the {PRISMA} framework, analyzing 486 articles from Scopus and Web of Science. The review focuses on key themes such as public perception, operational strategies, traffic impacts, safety considerations, and policy development. The results reveal that public acceptance of {ABs} varies widely across socio-demographic and cultural contexts. Adoption is notably higher among younger, wealthier, and technologically savvy individuals, highlighting the importance of targeted awareness campaigns. Operational strategies such as demand-responsive services, platooning, and skip-stop routes have demonstrated the potential to enhance the efficiency and appeal of {ABs}, optimizing both service delivery and user satisfaction. Traffic integration remains a critical factor, with {ABs} shown to improve traffic flow and reduce emissions in mixed-traffic environments. However, obstacles remain in managing {ABs} within heterogeneous traffic conditions, particularly in regions with diverse vehicle types and road usage patterns. Safety concerns, a central barrier to widespread adoption, require robust communication systems, emergency response protocols, and standardized safety frameworks to ensure passenger and pedestrian trust. Policy recommendations emerging from the review emphasize phased implementation, supportive regulatory frameworks, and pilot programs to build public trust and operational credibility. These findings underscore the transformative potential of {ABs} while highlighting the necessity of inclusive policies, comprehensive safety measures, and adaptive operational strategies to maximize their impact in diverse urban and rural settings.},

In this paper, we propose car-user-oriented and sustainable operating principles and embody them in a passenger matching model. Furthermore, we employ a solution approach including the spatial-temporal pruning strategies and a heuristic algorithm to guarantee the efficiency of larger-scale computing. Applying this system to the case of Beijing, results demonstrate that buspooling services could yield significant benefits to passengers, operators, and the environment. The consistency observed between the distribution of taxi trips and bus routes suggests that buspooling could effectively enhance subway accessibility, especially for residents in suburban areas. Moreover, findings from a sophisticated analysis can inform the design of a more attractive and ecofriendly system for intermodal transit services in practice.},

Several studies highlighted that introducing Demand Responsive Transport Services ({DRTs}) can improve {PT} performance in these areas. In Italy, several {DRTs} have been launched, characterized by flexible schedules with different operational configurations: fixed route, with and without detours and flexible route. Considering the importance of sharing lessons from pilots, the paper presents a {DRT} pilot study, conducted in Palermo (Italy) within the {WEAKI} {TRANSIT} project, identifying strategies for planning and designing on-demand shared systems. The pilot was conducted in a suburban area in the north of Palermo, covering about 10.5 km2 with the neighbourhoods of Partanna Mondello and Tommaso Natale. This area is poorly served by {PT} companies with low-frequency and low-reliability bus lines, thus a stop-based {DRT} service with two fixed routes and detours was hypothesized. The pilot was conducted during November and December 2022, with four cars, operating from 3 to 7 p.m., except Sunday. The service, free of charge, was addressed to students and teaching staff by University of Palermo. Through {SP} surveys, simulation model and pilot, we evaluate operational performance of the services (i.e. travel distance, waiting and in-vehicle times). We found the introduction of {DRTs} lead to increasing accessibility to main transit hubs and facilities, and a decrease in waiting times at stops and travel times. Nevertheless, considerations about financial feasibility and legal framework are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Ride-sourcing companies have worsened congestion in numerous cities worldwide, as many users are attracted from more sustainable modes. To reverse this trend, it is crucial to leverage the technology of connecting users and vehicles online and use it to strengthen public transport, which can be achieved by integrating on-demand pooled services with existing fixed-line services. We propose an efficient and practical integration idea: namely, to complement fixed bus lines with a fleet of smaller vehicles that follow flexible (on-demand) routes side-by-side with the fixed routes, so that part of the demand that would have used the fixed line can ride the flexible service instead. With this scheme, a smaller bus fleet is required, partially compensating for the increase in operators’ costs stemming from the flexible vehicles. This integration strategy favors mostly two types of users: those traveling in low-demand periods, through lower waiting times, and those located far from the bus stops, because the on-demand vehicles can reduce their access time. We develop simulations in real-world scenarios from Santiago, Chile, and Berlin, Germany, for the cases of human-driven and automated vehicles. Results show that when vehicles are automated: (i) A small number of on-demand vehicles can reduce average walking times from approximately 12 to 2 min while reducing operators’ costs, leading to a Pareto improvement, (ii) A larger number of on-demand vehicles can diminish total costs by 13\%–39\%, through a reduction in users’ costs, although increasing operators’ costs. If vehicles are not automated, total costs are reduced by more than 10\% in all of the scenarios analyzed, but a Pareto improvement is not always possible. In general, this mixed fixed/on-demand system outperforms the use of on-demand ridepooling only. Results are more promising in Berlin, because large buses are cheaper in Santiago and run more crowded, so it is more costly to partially replace them by smaller vehicles.},

However, the temporal variations in traveler preferences for flexible bus services remain largely unexplored in existing research. This constrains the realization of adaptive and customized solutions. Therefore, this study attempts to develop a distinct method for strategic planning of a flexible bus service. To this end, a combinatorial method is undertaken: quantitative social research (questionnaires) and spatial analysis. This combinatorial approach is applied at Korinth and Loutraki in Greece, two significant rural areas neighboring the Athens Metropolitan Area. The results signify that cost and time are the most crucial factors affecting the use of a flexible service. Furthermore, respondents preferred a door-to-door service in the morning and a stop-based service in the afternoon/evening. Concerning route planning, eight routes with different purposes are suggested (e.g., train feeder, touristic, etc.) covering adequately both urban and rural parts of the study area. Notably, the applied methodological approach can be a guideline for planners and policymakers, assisting them in finding effective strategies for introducing flexible public transport in rural areas, especially in contexts where collective transport culture is limited.},

	abstract = {As a result of the lack of access to efficient public transit in suburban areas, residents often have to use their own vehicles to commute either within the area, to neighboring regions, or to a public transit hub ({PTH}). Thanks to information and communication technologies, on-demand transit ({ODT}) is a potential solution being proposed and considered by transit agencies. Although {ODT} has shown the potential to enhance transit level of service, its efficiency depends on different parameters such as demand spatial and temporal distribution or the configuration of the service. In this study, we propose a novel configuration for an {ODT} service and apply it to the first part of a commuter’s trip, or the commuter’s “first mile.” The proposed configuration depends on the availability of smart devices installed at bus stops. Passengers request their rides via smart devices and receive real-time and personalized information about their ride requests to travel to a {PTH}. The proposed {ODT} service is modeled with the Simulation of Urban Mobility or {SUMO} simulation framework. To evaluate the performance of the {ODT} service, it is applied to the city of Terrebonne in Quebec, Canada. The proposed service is compared with existing bus transit operating in the area as well as a door-to-{PTH} service. The results of the comparison analysis reveal that the proposed {ODT} service may result in a significant 36\% reduction in total travel time as well as a 41\% reduction in detour time compared with the existing bus transit service. A detailed sensitivity analysis is also conducted to capture the impacts of different parameters, variables, and dispatching algorithms on the service performance.},

This paper is aimed at analyzing the effect of the additional requirements of {BEVs} on the cost efficiency of {SFT} services while considering different headways and slack time to accommodate route-deviation. Analytical models are used for detailed estimation of the total cost, including operator, user, and environmental costs, allowing a comparison with internal combustion engine ({ICEV}) vehicle technology, and three vehicle sizes: minivans, standard vans, and minibuses.

Feeder transportation services offer a solution by transporting passengers to areas where more options for public transport are available. On one hand, fully flexible demand-responsive feeder services ({DRFSs}) efficiently tailor their service to the needs of the passengers. On the other hand, traditional feeder services provide predictability and easier cost control. In this article, a semi-flexible {DRFS} is considered, which combines positive characteristics of both traditional services as well as fully flexible services. This feeder service has two types of bus stops: mandatory bus stops and optional bus stops. Mandatory bus stops are guaranteed to be visited by a bus within a certain time interval. Optional stops are only visited when there is demand for transportation nearby. The performance of this feeder service is optimized with the use of a new type of metaheuristic framework, which we denote as parameter space search. Experimental results on small benchmark instances indicate that the heuristic performs on average 12.42\% better than {LocalSolver}, a commercial optimization solver, with an average runtime of 2.1 s. Larger instances can also be solved, typically within 2 min.},

	abstract = {Semi-flexible transit ({SFT}) is commonly discussed as a cost-effective alternative to serving public transportation users in low-demand conditions. We hypothesize that joint optimization of service headway and slack time per trip for route deviation is essential for designing a schedule for the operation of an integrated {SFT} that can meet both fixed-route and paratransit demand. An integrated {SFT} has the potential to lower the cost of transportation for regular transit users (both operators and riders) while redirecting potential paratransit riders to less expensive transit modes; thus, reducing demand for overwhelmed paratransit services operating with limited resources. The optimization problem has three competing objectives: minimizing operator costs, minimizing user costs, and maximizing service benefits. Two state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms {NSGA}-{II} and {SMPSO} are compared to obtain the most representative deterministic Pareto optimal solution set. This study has three major contributions. First, quantile regression is used to suggest multiple slack time values for a given headway that transit planners can consider when generating a static schedule for {SFT} operation. Second, relationships derived to analyze cost trade-offs suggest that headway governs operator cost and is negatively correlated, user cost is positively and equally influenced by both variables, and slack time governs service benefit and is positively correlated. Third, sensitivity analysis for an integrated {SFT} operation reveals that low-capacity minivans and standard vans offer higher vehicle occupancy and cost efficiency, mostly economical for low to medium demand (5-20 pass/hr), low permissible deviation from the fixed route is desirable during peak hours to avoid delays for passengers on-board, and extreme weather conditions dramatically and negatively influence costs. Policy recommendations for integrated {SFT} implementation include a recommendation for fare structure design addressing service equity through surcharges/discounts, vehicle technology and service booking technology advancements for cost reduction, and fleet mix design through estimation of passenger loading profile. The application of the study methodology is demonstrated for a low-demand bus route in Regina, Canada.},

The review is based on a working definition of regional public transport with boundaries toward local as well as interregional public transport: Regional public transport (i) targets passengers travelling between separate urban areas or to rural areas and (ii) a majority of the trips are made on a regular basis. Our results suggest that preferences of regional travellers mainly conform to the preferences of local travellers, but some important differences have been revealed. Most notably, on-board comfort is a higher priority for regional travellers and is increasingly important with longer travel times. Network coverage and coordination are also more prominent features of regional public transport, presumably due to the more dispersed nature of regional public transport networks. These differences, and the fact that the prerequisites for regional public transport are in general substantially different compared to local and interregional public transport, support continued use of this categorisation in public transport research. We also conclude that there is a requirement for more knowledge about the specifics of regional public transport, as public transport research, thus far, has been largely focused on local travel. Research areas of particular interest are on-board comfort, operational aspects, travel time improvements, how the environmental impact of public transport services affects modal choice, and the influence of trip length on passenger preferences.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an agent-based model ({ABM}) to simulate and compare two different operation strategies of a public transport service in small-sized cities, namely a fixed-route transit ({FRT}) and a demand-responsive transport ({DRT}) service, under varying demand rates and supply configurations. The {ABM} builds upon a previous work by the Authors, where flexible and feeder services of a Mass Rapid Transit system were simulated. In this paper, instead of a many-to-one pattern typical of a feeder service, we considered a many-to-many one. The objective is to investigate the conditions that make a {DRT} more attractive than a {FRT} in small-sized cities and guide its design considering the demand fluctuation, land-use pattern, service constraints and passenger preferences. A dispatching algorithm for the {DRT} allows to assign each new trip request to a vehicle, and a couple of origin and destination stops, updating the vehicle schedule in real time. The service includes fixed and virtual stops, allowing request consolidation and balancing operator-related (cost of the service) and user-related (quality of service) needs. The model is applied to Vittoria (Italy), a small city with 60,000 residents in Southern Italy where most trips are made by car, also due to the absence of an urban public transport service. First results highlight the benefits of providing a flexible service compared to a fixed one to minimize detours, waiting times and walking distances experienced by passengers while allowing for a higher shareability and efficiency of the service.},

The methodology was applied to Acireale, a small town in Southern Italy. A redesign of the existing bus network and its integration with a flexible service was formulated. A scenario analysis was carried out by the evaluation of a simple accessibility measure; the computation of the Gini coefficient was performed to measure the social equity of different scenarios. Results show an increase in equity with a lower coverage of traditional lines and the introduction of the on-demand service. This approach based on easy-to-understand indicators can help the strategic planning of such services, which have the potential to find a trade-off between ridership and coverage as both desirable and conflicting goals in public transport planning.},

	abstract = {With growing dependence of many cities on urban mass transit, even limited disruptions of public transportation networks can lead to widespread confusion and significant productivity losses. A need exists for systematic approaches to developing efficient responses to minimize such negative impacts. We present an optimization-based approach that responds to degradations of urban transit rail networks by introducing smartly designed bus bridging services that take into consideration commuter travel demand at the time of the disruption. The approach consists of three fundamental steps, namely, (1) a column generation procedure to dynamically generate demand-responsive candidate bus routes, (2) a path-based multicommodity network flow model to identify the most effective combination of these candidate bus routes, and (3) another optimization-based procedure to determine simultaneously the optimal allocation of available vehicle resources among the selected routes and corresponding headways. The approach is applied to two case studies defined using actual data. The results show that the proposed approach can be carried out efficiently and that adding nonintuitive bus routes to the standard bus bridging services can significantly reduce the average travel delay. Moreover, the approach distributes delay more equitably. Many realistic operating constraints can also be handled.},

The most important conclusions are the following: (a) the private operating costs and the social costs of the restructured system, using higher standard buses, are considerably lower than the costs of the current system; (b) these cost reductions allow government authorities to introduce an important number of modernizing measures without subsidies and fare increases.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the success of private ridesourcing companies such as Uber and Lyft, transit agencies have started to consider integrating ridesourcing services (i.e. on-demand, app-driven ridesharing services) with public transit. Ridesourcing services may enhance the transit system in two major ways: replacing underutilized routes to improve operational efficiency, and providing lastmile connectivity to extend transit’s catchment area. While an integrated system of ridesourcing services and public transit is conceptually appealing, little is known regarding whether and how consumers might use a system like this and what key service attributes matter the most to them. This article investigates traveler responses to a proposed integrated transit system, named {MTransit}, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. We conducted a large-sample survey to collect both revealed preference ({RP}) and stated preference ({SP}) data and fit a {RP}-{SP} mixed logit model to examine the main determinants of commuting mode choice. The model results show that transfers and additional pickups are major deterrents for {MTransit} use. We further applied the model outputs to forecast the demand for {MTransit} under different deployment scenarios. We find that replacing low-ridership bus lines with ridesourcing services could slightly increase transit ridership while reducing operations costs. The service improvements offered by ridesourcing mainly come from reductions in wait time. Though relatively small in our study, another source of improvement is the decrease of in-vehicle travel time. Moreover, we find that when used to provide convenient last-mile connections, ridesourcing could provide a significant boost to transit. This finding verifies a popular notion among transit professionals that ridesourcing services can serve as a complement to public transit by enhancing last-mile transit access.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of computing all Pareto-optimal journeys in a dynamic public transit network for multiple criteria, such as arrival time and number of transfers. Existing algorithms consider this as a graph problem and solve it using various graph search algorithms. Unfortunately, this leads to either high query times or suboptimal solutions. We take a different approach. We introduce {RAPTOR}, our novel round-based public transit router. Unlike previous algorithms, it is not Dijkstra-based, looks at each route (such as a bus line) in the network at most once per round, and can be made even faster with simple pruning rules and parallelization using multiple cores. Because it does not rely on preprocessing, {RAPTOR} works in fully dynamic scenarios. Starting from arrival time and number of transfers as criteria, it can be easily extended to handle flexible departure times or arbitrary additional criteria. As practical examples we consider fare zones and reliability of transfers. When run on complex public transportation networks (such as London), {RAPTOR} computes all Pareto-optimal journeys between two random locations an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches, which easily enables interactive applications.},

The modes covered include conventional timetabled services .buses, trains etc.), taxis .both single- and multiple-hire), and other demand-responsive services. Tables of estimated aggregate demand are disaggregated so as to produce a stream of fully-articulated travel-requests. Individual requests are resolved as single- or multiple-leg journeys, through the use of request-broking and journey-planning modules that seek to minimise travellers' generalised costs. Journey-legs allocated to demand-responsive modes are handled by a ¯eet-scheduling module which includes provision for ``instantaneous'' as well as advance-notice bookings, and for contingent situations such as breakdowns and passenger no-shows. The ¯eet-scheduling and journey-planning modules are designed as embedded control systems and are intended for use in real-time as well as modelling applications. The paper describes the main analytical and procedural components of {LITRES}-2, and assesses some methodological issues arising from experience in recent planning studies. The system appears to be well suited for use in modelling situations where the critical issues are concerned with the supply rather than demand side of transportation activity.

	abstract = {The introduction of autonomous buses and taxis is expected to generate such benefits as cost reductions—and particularly for regional bus operations with a substantial deficit—as well as enhancing public transit accessibility through decreased trip costs. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the impacts of introducing autonomous buses and taxis on metropolitan transportation systems by quantifying the costs of travel in Japan, and to discuss the potential benefits. First, this study sets the assumptions on autonomous driving technology, including its impacts on vehicle costs, the decreased labor costs for driving and safety monitoring in buses and taxis, and decreased driving stress for private car users. Next, operating costs are computed for autonomous buses and taxis in Japanese metropolitan areas. The costs of travel, or the sum of monetary and time costs, are then computed with and without vehicle automation for different trip types in high- and low-density metropolitan areas. The results highlight that the costs of public transit trips that currently have a smaller share of time costs in overall trip costs could decrease considerably due to vehicle automation. For instance, costs for 10–20-km trip lengths could decrease by 44–61\% for taxi trips and 13–37\% for rail/bus trips with taxi access, followed by a decrease of 6–11\% for bus trips and 1–11\% for rail trips with bus access. Further, private car trip costs could decrease by 11–16\%. More substantial cost reductions in rail/bus trips with taxi access could occur in the case of smaller trip distances and/or in residential areas far from stations; larger reductions in rail trips with bus access could occur in low-density metropolitan areas. Finally, it is expected that vehicle automation in more fixed modes of public road transit could primarily benefit the transit industry and government, with such effects as improved labor productivity and reduced subsidies, while vehicle automation in more flexible modes could benefit metropolitan residents as well as the transit industry. This further suggests that a deficit of regional bus operations could be recovered during the transition to the full performance of autonomous buses.},

	abstract = {On-demand ridesplitting is a form of ridesourcing where riders with similar origins and destinations are matched to the same driver and vehicle in real time, and the ride and costs are split among users. With the convenience of all kinds of ridesourcing services, the number of ridesplitting passengers increases, which may have a great impact on the urban mobility. In this paper, we analyze ridesplitting behavior and its impact on multimodal mobility, e.g., vehicle kilometers traveled ({VKT}) and transportation modal shift, using real-world ridesourcing data extracted from an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China, and questionnaires filled by on-demand ridesplitting passengers. With the consideration of the {VKT} shifted from non-passenger/private vehicles, this paper uses the saved {VKT} of two ridesplitting types, e.g., {DiDi} Hitch and {DiDi} Express ridesplitting, to quantify the ridesplitting impact. For the whole ridesourcing ecosystem, ridesplitting is estimated to decrease 58,124 {VKT} per day in Hangzhou, of which Hitch and Express ridesplitting contribute 2175 km and 55,949 km per day, respectively. The saved {VKT} of Hitch is much smaller than Express ridesplitting for the following two reasons: (1) Hitch orders are fewer than Express ridesplitting; (2) more than half of the Hitch passengers shift modes from bus/metro transit or other non-passenger/private cars. This paper shines some lights on understanding the emerging on-demand ridesplitting behavior and quantifying its impact on multimodal urban mobility.},

For the public transport industry, these new services offer new chances but also risks, making planning models and tools for integrated intermodal network planning indispensable. We develop a strategic network planning optimization model for bus lines that allows for intermodal trips with {MoD} as a first or last leg. Starting from an existing public transport network, we decide simultaneously on the use of existing line segments in the future fixed-route network, on areas of the city where an integrated {MoD} service should be offered, on how {MoD} interacts with the fixed-route network via transfer points, and on passenger routes fulfilling given service-level requirements. The main challenges from a modeling point of view are to capture the interplay between {MoD} services and the fixed public network, as well as the approximation of {MoD} costs taking into account that vehicle utilization is a key factor influencing these costs. We develop a path-based formulation and a branch-and-price algorithm, as well as an enhanced enumeration-based approach, to solve real-world instances to proven optimality. The solution methods are tested on instances generated with the help of real-world data from a medium-sized German city, Göttingen, that currently operates around 20 bus lines.},

However, the existing studies in this area almost focus on human-driven vehicles which face some striking limitations (e.g., restricted crew scheduling and fixed vehicle capacity) and can weaken the overall benefits. This paper proposes a two-phase optimization procedure to fully unleash the potential of {MAEVs} by leveraging the strengths of {MAEVs}, including automatic allocation and charging of modules. In the first phase, a mixed integer programming model is established in the space-time-state framework to jointly optimize the {MAEV} routing and charging, passenger-to-vehicle assignment and vehicle capacity management for reserved passengers. A Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. In the second phase, three dispatching strategies are designed and optimized by a dynamic dispatching procedure to properly adapt the operation of {MAEVs} to emerging travel demands. A case study conducted on a major urban area of Beijing, China, demonstrates the high efficiency of the {MAEV} adoption in terms of resource utilization and environmental friendliness across a range of travel demand distributions, vehicle supply and module capacity scenarios.},

	abstract = {Urban public transportation agencies sometimes have to operate mixing vehicles of different sizes on their routes, due to resource limitations or historical reasons. Services with different passenger-carrying capacities are provided to passengers during a mixed-ﬂeet operation. A fundamental question arising here is how to optimally deploy a given ﬂeet of different bus sizes to provide services that minimize passenger waiting time. We formulate a mixed-ﬂeet vehicle dispatching problem as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming ({MINLP}) model to optimize dispatching schemes (dispatching orders and times) when a given set of buses of different sizes are available to serve demand along a route. The objective is to minimize the average passenger waiting time under time-dependent demand volumes. Stochastic travel times between stops and vehicle capacity constraints (i.e., introducing extra waiting time due to denied boarding) are explicitly modeled. A Simulated Annealing ({SA}) algorithm coupled with a Monte Carlo simulation framework is developed to solve large real-world instances in the presence of stochastic travel times. Results show that, in addition to dispatching headway, bus dispatching sequence can strongly affect waiting times under a mixed-ﬂeet operation. Indeed, with an optimal dispatching sequence, a more accurate adjustment of supply to demand is possible in accordance with time-dependent demand conditions, and the total savings in waiting time are mainly driven by a further reduction in the number of passengers left behind. The optimality of uneven dispatching headways stems from two elements: having a mixed ﬂeet and having localized peaks on demand that make buses run full.},

In this study, a joint optimization of running route and scheduling for responsive feeder transit under mixed demand (i.e., reservation and real-time demands) of the time-dependent road network was investigated. A two-stage optimization method was designed together with considering the mixed demands. At the first stage, the initial running route and scheduling were determined according to all reservation demands. At the second stage, the running route and scheduling were continuously optimized based on the real-time demands. The real-time demand responsive strategy, which is built up by using quantitative batch treatment rather than immediate treatment and dynamic route updating strategy for global optimization, were designed by utilizing the submission order of real-time demands. A joint optimization model of running route and scheduling was constructed based on the quantitative batch decision points in the time-dependent road network together with combination of the actual road network. In this model, the minimum total system cost was used, which is composed of the vehicle running costs and passengers' traveling time costs with constraints including vehicle capacity, passengers' time window, and vehicle running time. A solving algorithm based on the adaptive genetic algorithm was designed by considering the characteristics of the joint optimization model.},

In view of the highly dispersed and regular passenger flow, demand responsive transit is an important complementary means for traditional public transport to improve passenger satisfaction. However, high operating costs and low load factor will have a bad impact on the operation of public transport and reduce passenger satisfaction. In this work, firstly, by analyzing the demand frequency of historical travel stations, the stations with high demand are extracted by time periods as high probability travel points; On this basis, a dynamic vehicle dispatching optimization model is established, and the static vehicle dispatching is carried out with the goal of minimizing the running mileage of the bus system; Finally, based on the initial static route and the later real-time travel demand, the accurate dynamic planning algorithm is used to optimize the dynamic route with the goal of minimizing the change of the system mileage, so as to achieve timely response to the demand. The results show that the two-phase scheduling optimization model based on the station extraction strategy can provide a reasonable real-time vehicle scheduling and route optimization scheme, improve the utilization rate of vehicles and the passenger load factor, and provide a theoretical basis and application guidance for actual vehicle scheduling.},

Each entity has its own decision-making and planning component. Vehicles compete for a limited number of order requests, and decentralized stops manage the matching between a customer and a prospective vehicle. Scheduling and routing events take place highly dynamically. A simulation study evaluates a demand-responsive operation as a replacement for a fixed-route bus service. Results show that a total demand of 2.3 million rides can be fulfilled with a fleet of around 43,000 six-seater modules. In comparison with the current bus system, the total energy consumption and the system’s utilization are improved, while transport times and distances result in values below the bus system’s performance and therefore must be optimized in further research.},

The framework incorporates variable travel speeds and employs a genetic algorithm to optimize routes and operations compared to many studies using constant commercial speed. Experiments conducted in Hwaseong, South Korea, analyzed scenarios with varying service rates, vehicle capacities, and detour ratios. Results show that implementing punctuality-constrained {DRT} reduces total travel times by 14\% compared to subways and 36\% compared to buses, highlighting its potential to significantly improve user convenience and operational efficiency. The findings suggest that carefully designed {DRT} systems with highly reliable punctuality can enhance urban mobility by integrating seamlessly with existing transit networks, providing a cost-effective and reliable alternative to traditional public transport.},

	abstract = {Rural mobility has a lack of innovative proposals in contrast with its urban counterpart. This research aims to bring solutions that ease the implementation of reliable and flexible rural transportation. Demand-responsive transportation is chosen to develop a public transportation service providing interurban trips among several rural settlements. Given the characteristics of rural displacement demand, a novel approach is introduced to optimize the service’s economic costs: the dynamic transfer point allocation. The problem is fully formulated and an architecture is introduced describing the workflow of the whole system. Data from an interurban bus transportation service are used to build a case study of a rural area of Valencia, Spain, and develop several examples illustrating the benefits of the proposed approach. The results reveal that the dynamic creation of transfer points can simplify the transportation fleet’s itineraries and boost the amount of served travel requests. Finally, a discussion of the benefits and dangers of flexible features in rural transportation is developed, underscoring the need to achieve a balance between dynamic operation and service quality.},

To reduce computational effort, the problem is decomposed at the single vehicle level, where each best route is computed using an exact solver and new dynamic requests are assigned using a greedy insertion heuristic.

	abstract = {With the continuous expansion of urban trafﬁc operation scale, public transport emergencies occur from time to time, causing serious trafﬁc jams and potential safety hazards in a short time. In view of this, a new adaptive bus route optimization strategy based on the emergency demand responsive public transport is proposed. Firstly, in order to improve the ﬁne-grained passenger carrying capacity of emergency demand responsive public transport and build a clustering model of passenger information, this paper proposes an adaptive clustering algorithm, which considers the main inﬂuencing factors such as vehicle capacity, passenger travel time window and the number of stations visited. Aiming at minimizing the cost of vehicle operation and passenger trafﬁc, a multi-objective optimization model of emergency bus route is constructed based on Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows ({VRPTW}) to ensure the operation efﬁciency of emergency bus. Secondly, a Modiﬁed Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search with Nearest Vehicle Dispatch ({NVD}) algorithm ({MALNSN}) is proposed, which is an extension of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm ({ALNS}), by improving the generation rules of initial solutions with {NVD} and operator selection strategy with Modiﬁed Choice Function ({MCF}), and the effectiveness of algorithm is analyzed according to the Solomon benchmark. The average gain of the proposed {MALNSN} algorithm is 17.11\% higher than that of the original algorithm. Finally, based on the actual road network, experiments are carried out to compare the proposed algorithm with the representative algorithms. The experimental results show that the {MALNSN} algorithm proposed in this paper can not only ensure the stability of the algorithm, but also formulate a reasonable route optimization strategy in a shorter time, effectively reducing the consumption of transport capacity resources, improving the operation efﬁciency of public transport and increasing the accessibility of public transport. The theoretical analysis was consistent with the experimental results.},

	abstract = {Demand-responsive transportation ({DRT}) offers a flexible solution for transportation issues in areas with insufficient public transit. Unlike fixed-route buses, {DRT} dynamically adjusts routes based on user demand. However, without effective route optimisation, {DRT} can underperform compared with fixed-route buses. This study proposes a method to reduce passenger waiting and boarding times by applying a deep Q-network ({DQN}) algorithm to establish dynamic routes for semi-dynamic {DRT} systems in urban residential areas. A simulation was conducted to compare the performance of fixed-route and dynamic-route systems, analysing how changes in passenger demand affect waiting and travel times. Results indicate that dynamic routes optimised by the {DQN} algorithm achieved higher boarding and alighting rates across all demand levels compared with fixed routes. In addition, even under high demand, dynamic-route {DRTs} reduced waiting and travel times, demonstrating superior efficiency. These findings confirm that dynamic-route {DRTs} enhance service quality and operational performance in residential areas.},

	abstract = {Demand-responsive connector services ({DRC}) are an important means to improve the current mobility connection problem. In this study, we develop a hybrid model for the minimization of total system cost for demand response shuttle buses, which includes operating cost and user cost, with fleet size per hour as the optimization variable of the model. The relevant variables are analyzed and numerically modeled by Matlab, and the relationship between fleet size, vehicle capacity and demand density and waiting time, onboard time, vehicle travel distance, and total system cost is analyzed. The results indicate that introducing financial subsidies markedly lowers the critical demand density necessary to ensure system viability. Moreover, subsidy intensity is positively associated with the service’s operational robustness. Through parametric examination, we observe a strictly monotonic relationship between subsidy magnitude and demand thresholds: as subsidy levels increase, the minimum demand requirements for sustainable operation decrease in a consistent, progressive manner; meanwhile, the optimal fleet size exhibits an approximately linear relationship with travel demand per unit area across varying vehicle capacities. Notably, an increase in vehicle capacity corresponds to a decrease in the growth rate of the required fleet size. This model demonstrates robust adaptability across diverse operational scenarios and serves as an effective tool for evaluating the efficiency of resource allocation in demand-responsive transit ({DRT}) services. Furthermore, it provides valuable theoretical support for the scheduling and planning of public transportation systems, particularly in low-density urban environments.},

The present study further examines the demand threshold of four public transit systems: {DRT}, {FRT}, fixed-route but non-fixed-point transit and dynamic stop transit, which are designated to feed urban rail transit. It constructs user cost models for these four transit systems, where we aim to find the system with the “best” user experience. The demand at which the user costs of two transit systems are equal is referred to as the critical demand. After deriving the analytical expression for the critical demand, a sensitivity analysis of the analytical solution is conducted. The results indicate that {DRT} is optimal for low demand density scenarios. If we allow more flexibility to transit services compared with {FRT}, fixed-route but non-fixed-point transit proves superior for higher demand. Additionally, the critical demands between {DRT} and {FRT}, as well as that between {DRT} and fixed-route but non-fixed-point transit, are influenced by the bus speed and passenger walking speed, where the impact has an upper bound; at the same time, the fleet size also affects the critical demands, where the impact has a lower bound.},

This study focuses on a novel battery electric bus ({BEB}) charging scheduling problem involving solar photovoltaic ({PV}) and battery energy storage facilities. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to schedule {BEB} charging and control solar {PV} energy simultaneously. The model handles a range of realistic considerations, including heterogeneous {BEBs} regarding battery capacities, peak net charging power costs, flexible charging powers, and multi-route-multi-depot scheduling. A key point of our model is the introduction of variable charging power decisions designed to align {BEB} charging demands with solar {PV} production. The optimization objective is to minimize the sum of charging costs, carbon emission costs, energy storage costs, and revenue (negative cost) from solar {PV} energy sales. The model empowers public transport agencies to swiftly generate daily {BEB} charging schedules given daily solar and weather variations. A case study is performed in Beijing, China, utilizing actual bus trajectory data, weather conditions, solar irradiance, and detailed built environment data of bus depots.

The static strategy will occur deviations in this situation. This study proposes a novel planning method to address the above issue. First, a spatiotemporal clustering algorithm is proposed to generate joint stations based on the passenger travel demand. Second, the method models the multiline customized bus optimization problem as a Markov decision process and uses a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to ensure effective training and response to incomplete information scenarios. Finally, the rationality of the proposed planning method is verified in a case study of customized bus area in Chongqing, China.

	abstract = {Integrating emerging shared mobility with traditional fixed-line public transport is a promising solution to the mismatch between supply and demand in urban transportation systems. The advent of modular vehicles ({MVs}) provides opportunities for more flexible and seamless intermodal transit. The {MVs}, which have been implemented, are comprised of automated modular units ({MUs}), and can dynamically change the number of {MUs} comprising them at different times and stops. However, this innovative intermodal urban transit brings with it a new level of dynamism and uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the timetable and the vehicle schedule within an intermodal urban transit network utilizing {MVs} within the context of distributionally robust optimization ({DRO}), which allows {MVs} to dynamically (de)couple at each stop and permits flexible circulations of {MUs} across different transportation modes. We propose a {DRO} formulation to explore the trade-off between operators and passengers, with the objective of minimizing the worst-case expectation of the weighted sum of passengers’ and operating costs. Furthermore, to address the computational intractability of the proposed {DRO} model, we design a discrepancy-based ambiguity set to reformulate it into a mixed-integer linear programming model. In order to obtain high-quality solutionss of realistic instances, we develop a customized decomposition-based algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The computational results of real-world case studies based on the operational data of Beijing Bus Line illustrate that the proposed integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling method reduces the expected value of passengers’ and operating costs by about 6\% in comparison with the practical timetable and fixed-capacity vehicles typically used in the Beijing bus system.},

	abstract = {The transition to alternative energy sources and the adoption of on-demand operating modes in urban bus systems are crucial steps towards reducing carbon footprints and improving public transit services. This paper presents a two-phase approach for the collaborative optimization of charging schedules and passenger services, aimed at enhancing the operation of on-demand electric bus systems. First, we propose a label-setting dynamic programming algorithm that enables the efficient generation of bus-trips for each bus line in response to passenger requests. Second, we introduce a time–space network optimization model that facilitates integrated multiple bus-trip planning for the transit network, involving multiple bus lines and charging spots. The model selects bus-trips from various time–space arcs, which represent passenger carrying, bus deployment, and bus charging activities. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a case study using real-world data from bus lines in Beijing, China. Computational results demonstrate that our approach can handle on-demand electric bus operations within minutes of solution time, efficiently serving over 2,000 passengers. Practically, our approach achieves a notable reduction in average transit time and effectively reduces the waste of public transit resources. The proposed approach can serve as a beneficial tool for decision-makers and operators seeking to enhance the performance and environmental impact of their electric bus systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper we assess an on-demand public transportation system through a simulation study. The on-demand system makes use of minibuses that have neither fixed itineraries nor fixed stops. The minibuses are rerouted online to dynamically accommodate the requests received by the users.
To use the on-demand service users communicate, close to their desired departure time, the origin and destination of the trip.
If the estimated arrival time at destination fulfills the user acceptance threshold, it will be chosen. In the simulation we allow the user to walk, to use the on-demand service, a bus or a private car.
We will consider a large number of scenarios to evaluate the potential
costs/benefits of the introduction of an on-demand service. We will also analyze the scalability and the responsiveness of the service. The results suggest that an on-demand public transportation system would be preferred by most users to the private car and to a bus service. This in turn would imply a more efficient and environmentally friendly transportation system.},

The combination of an on-demand and line-based service holds the promise of improved mobility and increased service coverage. However, to date, it remains unknown whether {DRT} services deliver these much anticipated improvements. This study presents an assessment framework to evaluate the performance of {DRT} and related changes in accessibility, and performs an empirical analysis for a recently introduced {DRT} service in the Netherlands. The framework includes a performance benchmark between {DRT} and {FT} based on the computation of generalized journey times of the {DRT} rides and the {FT} alternatives, and can help identify whether {DRT} is used as a complement or a substitute for {FT}. The framework covers the spatial and temporal dimensions, and the explicit consideration of rejected trips is an integral part of the evaluation. Results suggest large accessibility improvements for {DRT} users, especially for some underserved origin–destination pairs.},

This service, providing advanced, personalized and ﬂexible demandresponsive {PT}, is offered to speciﬁc clientele, especially commuters. The present work analyzes, for the ﬁrst time, the evolution of this new {PT} concept across 30 Chinese cities where {CB} systems are currently in operation or under construction. Unlike conventional bus transit service, {CB} users are actively involved in various operational planning activities. {CB} personalizes {PT} service by using interactive and integrated information platforms, such as internet website, telephone and smartphone. The analysis comprises three components: ﬁrst, a comprehensive examination of the background of {CB} and its temporal and spatial distribution in China; second, an analysis of the operation-planning process, including elements of online demand collection, network route design, timetable development, vehicle scheduling, crew scheduling, real-time control, and fare design and collection: third, a summary of the results of the examination and analysis, presenting pros, cons and recommendations. The successful implementation of {CB} in China demonstrates that this new {PT} service concept can effectively meet the ever-increasing mobility needs of large populations nation-wide. Similarly, the present work can provide a valuable reference for policymakers, academic researchers, {PT} practitioners and others worldwide.},

	abstract = {The development of modern telecommunications allows the concept of a “smart city” to increase the flexibility of public transportation significantly and, thus, improve population mobility. In this regard, public transportation represents a demandresponsive transit ({DRT}) system. This system occupies an intermediate position between route systems and taxi services and ensures flexibility in providing on-demand transport services. The article describes the main technologies that can be used in the {DRT} system, including those with fixed routes (Flexible-Route Segments, Request Stops) and without fixed routes ({DemandResponsive} Connector, Feeder Service, Zone Route, Point Deviation). Despite the wide international experience in implementing {DRT} in practice, there are no clear criteria to determine the conditions, under which it is reasonable to introduce a particular technology of flexible service for passengers. The article systematizes the factors that determine the feasibility of transferring a bus route to the {DRT} system in particular time intervals and also determines a sequence of actions for the introduction of flexible modes of public transport services. The considered technologies to manage public transportation on demand show that it is possible to combine regular traffic and demand-responsive service, using these modes at different times. Such an approach allows reducing the carrier’s costs while maintaining or even improving the quality of public transportation compared with systems implementing only flexible service modes.},

In recent years, the ability of {DRT} concepts to provide eﬃcient, viable transport services has been greatly enhanced by the use of transport telematics as demonstrated in a variety of environments across Europe. The success of British local authorities in winning substantial funding under the Rural and Urban Bus Challenge programmes for the implementation of {DRT} has resulted in widespread interest in ﬂexible forms of transport. It is thus timely to evaluate the impact of this substantial investment. Drawing on the experience of a number of {UK} schemes, the paper assesses the reasons for the new-found success of what is becoming a relatively well-accepted mode by concentrating on a variety of factors including: service characteristics (particularly route ﬂexibility, ﬂexibility of booking method and pre-booking regime), emerging markets and the overall contribution of {DRT} to increased social inclusion and intermodality. Impediments to the development of {DRT} services are highlighted. The paper also discusses current research into the next generation of {DRT} services and concludes by identifying some key issues for policy-makers concerned with the future implementation of {DRT} services.},

Through a series of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in New South Wales, Australia, the article identifies barriers to greater use of flexible transport services in low-density urban areas. These five sets of barriers include: institutional frameworks such as regulation; economic issues of funding and cost; operational issues such as fleet and vehicles; operator and community attitudes, awareness and cultures; and information and education.

It is crucial to study the feasibility and advantages of these novel systems before implementation to prevent failure and financial loss. In this work, an extensive comparison of demand responsive transport and conventional public transport is provided by incorporating a dynamic routing algorithm into an agent-based traffic simulation. The results show that replacing conventional public transport with demand responsive transport will improve the mobility by decreasing the perceived travel time by passengers without any extra cost under certain circumstances.

	abstract = {The increasing demand for shared mobility services has led to multiple Public-Private Partnerships ({PPP}), where public transit agencies and mobility providers work together to increase transit service coverage. However, several partnerships have failed due to budget constraints and lack of ridership. Furthermore, the limited datasharing agreements restrict the analysis and dissemination of outcomes. This paper analyzes the integration of shared-mobility services into the public transit system using data from pilot programs in Austin, Texas. The use of Transportation Network Companies ({TNCs}) and microtransit service is evaluated as first-mile-last-mile ({FMLM}) and door-to-door solutions. The associated {TNC}, microtransit, and bus transit demand are analyzed using ridership data, and the trip characteristics are discussed and compared. Then, after controlling for confounding variables through matching, a difference-in-differences ({DID}) model is used to infer the effect of microtransit on bus transit demand. Specifically, by evaluating bus ridership before and after implementing the microtransit program, the {DID} model estimates the change in bus demand attributed to microtransit. The results suggest that the {TNC} services, focusing only on {FMLM}, were not as popular as microtransit services offering {FMLM} and intrazonal trips. Even though the microtransit trips were longer and, in some cases, the driver response times were higher than for {TNC} trips. Also, the {DID} model demonstrates that the microtransit service did not substantially impact the bus transit ridership, suggesting that the trips were mainly used for intrazonal doorto-door trips and not for {FMLM} trips. A further discussion highlights the need for performance metrics beyond demand and costs to capture the benefits of these partnerships for improving mobility, safety, and customer experience.},

	abstract = {In rural regions, needs-based mobility services play an important role in the provision of public services. Shared Mobility Services can optimally complement local public transportation such as buses and trains, even in rural regions, and support the transformation of transportation. There is already research on Shared Mobility Services in the literature, but there is no comparison between all of Germany-wide and a specific municipality. We were interested in learning to what extent there is acceptance among citizens and what their usage behavior is towards such new alternatives. We also aimed to find out whether there are differences between large cities and rural regions and to what extent they differ from each other. In this case study, interplay was demonstrated using the example of a funded Smart City mobility project in a German rural municipality. The objective was to show whether the potential exists to initiate traffic turnaround with the help of Shared Mobility Services. In a quantitative survey of 418 German citizens, 114 of them from the rural municipality, the acceptance and usage behavior of Shared Mobility Services (in the form of car, bike and e-scooter sharing) was investigated. The results show that participants are very interested in Shared Mobility Services and have already gained initial experience with such services. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive services; for instance, the demand for car sharing is still too low, as many citizens still own a private vehicle. Our results show that citizens are too little informed about Shared Mobility Services and that these services need to be advertised much more strongly and clearly, both in analog and digitally. Our study shows that traffic turnaround can be achieved and that many citizens can imagine greater use of Shared Mobility Services in their everyday lives in the future. However, for this to happen, the necessary infrastructure must be in place in rural regions, and local authorities must motivate citizens with sufficient educational work about what is on offer and how to use it.},

We investigate how microtransit services can be integrated with existing public transport solutions (bus, train) as a flexible shared mobility alternative in rural areas and how to make them attractive alternatives to individual car use. We combine large neighborhood search with agent-based modeling and simulation to validate generated schedules for a microtransit service in terms of vulnerability to tardiness in passenger behavior or service provision. This includes the study of how disturbances, such as delays in service provision or late arrivals of passengers affect the stability of a transport schedule concerning a reliable timely delivery to transfer stops. We explore how simulation can be utilized as a means to fine-tune provider policies, e.g., how long vehicles may wait for late passengers before they depart.},

	abstract = {Rural regions in industrialised countries are facing problems in public transport ({PT}) provision against the backdrop of demographic change, urbanisation and austerity policies. However, innovative mobility concepts evolve under technological developments. Demand responsive transport ({DRT}) has been identified in research to meet the challenges and efficiently improve mobility through the concept of ride-pooling. Still, most of these {DRT} services are being investigated in urban settings with high mobility demand and population density. Research on low-demand regions, such as the Oberharz in Germany, is rarely considered. Moreover, the applied {DRT} services come with several restrictions regarding stop locations, customer target groups or spatial restrictions. Therefore, this paper fills this gap through spatial and temporal analysis of a real-life, fully flexible and true door-to-door {DRT} experiment. Over a 6-months period around 38,000 trips took place in the Oberharz. The analysis of these trips shows that an unrestricted {DRT} service between three main centres (Goslar, Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Osterode) results in main travel axes between these cities while the more remote areas forfeit mobility to these centres of public service provision. Consequently, a feeder-trunk system should be favoured for future {DRT} services in low-demand areas to sustainably improve mobility in remote regions. The complementary extension of the existing {PT} through such a {DRT} service should then meet mobility needs of rural areas to redeem car dependency and improve mobility for all population groups.},

	abstract = {Autonomous on-demand mobility systems, especially ride-pooling services, except for providing convenient transportation for the people, could potentially improve the traffic congestion in urban environments by reducing the number of private vehicles. In this paper, we introduce an Autonomous On-Demand Ride-Pooling ({AODRP}) system, which uses a rather realistic customer-model that is sensitive to waiting times. To quantify the benefits that the {AODRP} system could have on a city network, a case study in Munich is performed with a shared fleet of vehicles. Different scenarios, in which private vehicle trips are partly replaced with ride-pooling trips until an adoption rate of 15\%, are investigated for varying allowed customer detour times. The results show that the benefits of an {AODRP} service are observed from a certain adoption rate. For low demand level of 1\%, the ride-pooling service even increases Vehicle Miles Traveled ({VMT}) in the system, due to the empty trips generated while going to pick up customers. For higher adoption rates, pooling makes up for the additional empty {VMT} starting from approximately 5\% adoption rate. An analysis of change in {VMT} per road type reveals that the {AODRP} system especially reduces traffic on major roads, in which nowadays the highest level of congestion is observed, while extra {VMT} due to empty pick-up trips are concentrated on minor roads.},

One potential benefit of ride sharing is increased system efficiency. However, it is not clear what the trade-offs are between the efficiency gains and the reduction in quality of service. To quantify those trade-offs, an open-source simulation environment is introduced, which is capable of evaluating a large class of operational policies for ride-sharing mobility-on-demand systems. The impact of ride sharing on efficiency and service level is assessed for several benchmark operational policies from the literature and for different transportation scenarios: first a dense urban scenario, then a line-shaped, rural one. Based on the results of these case studies, we find that the efficiency gains in ride sharing are relatively small and potentially hard to justify against quality of service concerns such as reduced convenience, loss of privacy, and higher total travel and drive times. Furthermore, in the assessed scenarios, the relatively low occupancy of the vehicles suggests that smaller vehicles with 4–6 seats, able to handle occasional ride sharing, may be preferable to larger and more expensive vehicles such as minibuses.},

	abstract = {Background: Western countries are facing the challenges of an imminent shortage of physicians, especially general practitioners. As a consequence longer travel times to doctors' practices may arise. This study aimed to investigate the mobility behavior of a rural population in terms of medical consultations. Methods: An exploratory mixed-methods design was conducted in the Waldshut district of the federal state Baden-Württemberg in Germany. Focus groups and a single telephone-interview with representatives, occupationally affiliated with mobility in the district (e.g. representatives of public transport, nursing-services or the District Office Waldshut), were performed in 2016 and analyzed using Mayring's structuring content analysis. A questionnaire based on the collected qualitative data was subsequently distributed to a random sample of 1000 adult inhabitants living in the Waldshut district. Quantitative data were analyzed employing descriptive statistics. Results: Qualitatively, four focus groups and one single telephone-interview with a total of 20 participants were performed. Therein the necessity of reaching a nearby general practitioner and the importance of individual motor traffic was emphasized. Novel mobility modes of ride sharing and telemedicine were controversially discussed as future transport and consultation options, respectively. Quantitatively, 277 questionnaires (27.7\%) were valid and included in our analysis. Mean age was 51 years ({SD} = 18.5) and 58\% (n = 160) were female. Irrespective of the mode of transport 60\% (n = 166) expected to reach their general practitioner within 15 min. Using the possibility of multiple answers 47\% (n = 192) stated to use a car in order to reach their general practitioner, public transport was used by 5\% (n = 19). Nearly 80\% (n = 220) could imagine sharing a car with well-known persons for consultations. Turning to a general practitioner via telemedicine was imaginable for 32\% (n = 91). Conclusions: Individual motor car traffic seems to be an important factor in providing accessibility to rural medical care. As a supplementation, web based ride sharing has economic and structural potential for reaching a doctor's practice. However, familiarity and trustworthiness need to be guaranteed within this flexible transport mode. Furthermore, telemedicine may be a future approach in order to reduce travel time to a doctor's practice. © 2018 The Author(s).},

A counter-balance force (Extra-detour Effect), occurs when iii) the number of passengers per vehicle increases and users face longer detours. At low demand levels, there is little sharing and the Mohring effect prevails; as demand grows, more passengers per vehicle push for the Extra-detour Effect to dominate; eventually, vehicles run at capacity, and the Better-matching Effect prevails. The last two effects are specific to {ODRP} as the routes are not fixed but adapted online. Our simulations show that considering both users’ and operators’ costs, scale economies prevail, and that {ODRP} with human-driven vehicles and walks allowed has total costs similar to door-to-door systems with driverless vehicles.},

            Traffic is a challenge in rural and urban areas alike with negative effects ranging from congestion to air pollution. Ride-sharing poses an appealing alternative to personal cars, combining the traffic-reducing ride bundling of public transport with much of the flexibility and comfort of personal cars. Here we study the effects of the underlying street network topology on the viability of ride bundling analytically and in simulations. Using numerical and analytical approaches we find that system performance can be measured in the number of scheduled stops per vehicle. Its scaling with the request rate is approximately linear and the slope, that depends on the network topology, is a measure of the ease of ridesharing in that topology. This dependence is caused by the different growth of the route volume, which we compute analytically for the simplest networks served by a single vehicle.},

This paper studies a prospective transportation system in which shared autonomous vehicles ({SAVs}) providing Dial-a-Ride services in urban and rural areas must meet a large number of passenger requests (at least 105 per day). We consider those {SAVs} likely to replace, in the future, most of the individual vehicles inside urban areas. We address this very large-scale problem with a greedy insertion heuristic that involves a specific filtering system design in order to speed up the decision process and relies on an original network-driven encoding of the routes. Experimental results show that en-route vehicles can be drastically reduced by such systems using a fleet of {SAVs} of capacity 10, decreasing the vehicle number by more than 98\%, compared to a situation where all travel demands would rely on personal vehicles. In addition, thanks to the filtering system, the total execution time can be reduced by almost 97\% compared to the classic best-fit insertion heuristic, while maintaining the quality of the solution. This opens the way to the adaptation of our algorithms to a dynamic real-time context.},

This paper studies the relationship between the value generated by shared rides and the detours they create for riders. We establish a limit on the sum of value and detour, and we prove that this leads to a tight bound on the Pareto frontier of values and detours in a general setting with an arbitrary number of requests. We explicitly compute the Pareto frontier for one family of city topologies and construct it via simulation for several more networks, including one based on ride-sharing data from commute hours in Manhattan. We find that average detours are usually small, even in low-demand-density settings. We also find that by carefully choosing the match objective, detours can be reduced with a relatively small impact on values and that the density of ride requests is far more important than detours for the effective operations of a shared rides service. In response, we propose that platforms implement a two-product version of shared rides and limit the worst-case detours of its users.

There are great expectations on the impact that driverless demand-responsive transit ({DDRT}) systems can have on a regional setting. Nevertheless, the application of {DDRT} in such type of setting has not been widely studied, in particular for scenarios where the system is an addition to the existing alternatives (as characteristic of the early diffusion stage of an innovation). This study provides an assessment of the early-stage operation of a regional {DDRT} system used by a small portion of the entire potential adopters. A methodological approach is built upon an agent-based model through which the daily operation of a {DDRT} system is simulated in detail. This approach is applied to a case study in Portugal considering scenarios varying in terms of several operational parameters, adoption rates (from 1 to 20\%), and types of services (private versus shared rides). Results show that each vehicle in the {DDRT} system with shared rides could replace up to 13 private vehicles with a decrease in the vehicle-kilometers traveled of 1\%. The {DDRT} system operation is profitable even with low adoption rates (starting from 2\% for the system with shared rides). When considering the adoption rate of 5\%, the system with shared rides is 54\% more profitable than the one with private rides, but, from the perspective of travelers, shared rides lead to longer waiting times and detours.},

The paper summarizes the existing knowledge on the use of pooled-ride services, factors in travel mode service options for customers, available policy and planning strategies to incentivize sharing vehicles, and effects of the {COVID}-19 pandemic on shared-ride travel. Overall, research shows that ridepooling options are more likely to be considered by public transit users who have lower household incomes, while ridesourcing users of upper-class backgrounds are less likely to consider moving to a shared-ride service. Travel time and trip cost are the most important factors for travelers determining whether to use a ridesplitting or microtransit service rather than a ride-alone ridesourced trip. Existing policy and planning tools targeting pooled travel or {TNCs} can be expanded on and specified for on-demand ridepooling services, such as offering better incentives to use shared vehicles and increased access to curb areas or travel lanes, but the most effective strategies will include increasing the user costs for parking or riding alone.},

	abstract = {On-Demand Ride-Pooling services have the potential to increase traffic efficiency compared to private vehicle trips by decreasing parking space needed and increasing vehicle occupancy due to higher vehicle utilization and shared trips, respectively. Thereby, an operator controls a fleet of vehicles that serve requested trips on-demand while trips can be shared. In this highly dynamic and stochastic setting, asymmetric spatio-temporal request distributions can drive the system towards an imbalance between demand and supply when vehicles end up in regions with low demand. This imbalance would lead to low fleet utilization and high customer waiting times. This study proposes a novel rebalancing algorithm to predictively reposition idle fleet vehicles to reduce this imbalance. The algorithm first samples artificial requests from a predicted demand distribution and simulates future fleet states to identify supply shortages. An assignment problem is formulated that assigns repositioning trips considering multiple samples and forecast horizons. The algorithm is implemented in an agent-based simulation framework and compared to multiple state-of-the-art rebalancing algorithms. A case study for Chicago, Illinois shows the benefits of applying the repositioning strategy by increasing service rate and vehicle revenue hours by roughly 50\% compared to a service without repositioning. It additionally outperforms all comparison algorithms by serving more customers, increasing the pooling efficiency and decreasing customer waiting time regardless of the forecasting method applied. As a trade-off, the computational time increases, but with a termination within a couple of seconds it is still applicable for large-scale real world instances.},

We address this shortcoming by formulating user net benefit stemming from pooling as a compensatory function where the additional travel time and on-board discomfort need to be compensated by the price discount for a traveller to choose a pooled ride over a private ride. The proposed formulation is embedded in a method for matching travel requests and vehicles. We conduct a series of experiments investigating how the potential of ride-pooling services depends on demand characteristics, user preferences and the pricing policy adopted by the service provider. Our results suggest that the total vehicle mileage savings found by previous studies is only attainable when users are very willing to share their ride (i.e. attach low premium to private rides) and are offered a 50\% discount for doing so.},

To do so, we generate a broad range of synthetic, yet plausible demand patterns. We experiment with the number of attraction centres, the dispersion of destinations around these centres, and the trip length distribution. We apply a strategic ride-pooling algorithm across the generated demand patterns to identify shareability potential using a series of metrics related to ridepooling. Our findings indicate that, under a fixed demand level, vehicle-hour reduction due to ride-pooling can range between 18 and 59\%. These results depend on the concentration of travel destinations around the centre and the trip length distribution. Ride-pooling becomes more efficient when trips are longer and destinations are more concentrated. A shift from a monocentric to a polycentric demand pattern is found to have a limited impact on the prospects of ride-pooling.},

	abstract = {Shared autonomous (fully-automated) vehicles ({SAVs}) represent an emerging transportation mode for driverless and on-demand transport. Early actors include Google and Europe’s {CityMobil}2, who seek pilot deployments in low-speed settings. This work investigates {SAVs}’ potential for U.S. urban areas via multiple applications across the Austin, Texas, network. This work describes advances to existing agent- and network-based {SAV} simulations by enabling dynamic ride-sharing ({DRS}, which pools multiple travelers with similar origins, destinations and departure times in the same vehicle), optimizing fleet sizing, and anticipating profitability for operators in settings with no speed limitations on the vehicles and at adoption levels below 10 \% of all personal trip-making in the region. Results suggest that {DRS} reduces average service times (wait times plus in-vehicle travel times) and travel costs for {SAV} users, even after accounting for extra passenger pick-ups, drop-offs and non-direct routings. While the base-case scenario (serving 56,324 person-trips per day, on average) suggest that a fleet of {SAVs} allowing for {DRS} may result in vehicle-miles traveled ({VMT}) that exceed person-trip miles demanded (due to anticipatory relocations of empty vehicles, between trip calls), it is possible to reduce overall {VMT} as trip-making intensity ({SAV} membership) rises and/or {DRS} users become more flexible in their trip timing and routing. Indeed, {DRS} appears critical to avoiding new congestion problems, since {VMT} may increase by over 8 \% without any ride-sharing. Finally, these simulation results suggest that a private fleet operator paying \$70,000 per new {SAV} could earn a 19 \% annual (long-term) return on investment while offering {SAV} services at \$1.00 per mile for a non-shared trip (which is less than a third of Austin’s average taxi cab fare).},

To evaluate the service quality of ridepooling as compared to bus services, and to simulate bus rides during the evening hours, transport requests are generated using a predictive simulation. To this end, a framework in the programming language R is created, which automatically combines generalized linear models for count regression to model the demand at each bus stop. Furthermore, we use classification models for the prediction of trip destinations. To solve the resulting dynamic dial-a-ride problem, a rolling-horizon algorithm based on the iterative solution of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Models ({MILP}) is used. A feasible-path heuristic is used to enhance the performance of the algorithm in presence of high request densities. This allows an estimation of the number of cabs needed depending on the weekday to realize the same or a better general service quality as the bus system.},

Then, shared mobility is the short-term access to shared vehicles according to the user’s needs and convenience. The contributions and added value of this paper are to provide an up-to-date and well-structured review on the area of shared mobility to researchers and practitioners of the transport sector. Hence, this paper presents a bibliographical review of shared mobility and its diverse modalities, as an alternative to individual transportation, especially in cases of individual automobiles or short trips restricted to an urban city. The present literature review on shared modes of transportation has discovered that the introduction of these modes alone will not solve transportation problems in large cities, with elevated and growing motorization rates. However, it can among the strategies employed to help alleviate the problems caused by traffic jams and pollution by reducing the number of vehicles in circulation, congestions, and the urban emission of polluting gases. Thus, the implementation of shared mobility schemes offers the potential to enhance the efficiency, competitiveness, social equity, and quality of life in cities. This paper covers the fundamental aspects of vehicle and/or ride sharing in urban centers, and provides an overview of current shared mobility systems.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Ride-sharing services can provide not only a very personalized mobility experience but also ensure efficiency and sustainability via large-scale ride pooling. Large-scale ride-sharing requires mathematical models and algorithms that can match large groups of riders to a fleet of shared vehicles in real time, a task not fully addressed by current solutions. We present a highly scalable anytime optimal algorithm and experimentally validate its performance using New York City taxi data and a shared vehicle fleet with passenger capacities of up to ten. Our results show that 2,000 vehicles (15\% of the taxi fleet) of capacity 10 or 3,000 of capacity 4 can serve 98\% of the demand within a mean waiting time of 2.8 min and mean trip delay of 3.5 min.
          , 
            
              Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (
              i
              ) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (
              ii
              ) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with ∼3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.},

	abstract = {Shared autonomous (fully-automated) vehicles ({SAVs}) represent an emerging transportation mode for driverless and on-demand transport. Early actors include Google and Europe’s {CityMobil}2, who seek pilot deployments in low-speed settings. This work investigates {SAVs}’ potential for U.S. urban areas via multiple applications across the Austin, Texas, network. This work describes advances to existing agent- and network-based {SAV} simulations by enabling dynamic ride-sharing ({DRS}, which pools multiple travelers with similar origins, destinations and departure times in the same vehicle), optimizing fleet sizing, and anticipating profitability for operators in settings with no speed limitations on the vehicles and at adoption levels below 10 \% of all personal trip-making in the region. Results suggest that {DRS} reduces average service times (wait times plus in-vehicle travel times) and travel costs for {SAV} users, even after accounting for extra passenger pick-ups, drop-offs and non-direct routings. While the base-case scenario (serving 56,324 person-trips per day, on average) suggest that a fleet of {SAVs} allowing for {DRS} may result in vehicle-miles traveled ({VMT}) that exceed person-trip miles demanded (due to anticipatory relocations of empty vehicles, between trip calls), it is possible to reduce overall {VMT} as trip-making intensity ({SAV} membership) rises and/or {DRS} users become more flexible in their trip timing and routing. Indeed, {DRS} appears critical to avoiding new congestion problems, since {VMT} may increase by over 8 \% without any ride-sharing. Finally, these simulation results suggest that a private fleet operator paying \$70,000 per new {SAV} could earn a 19 \% annual (long-term) return on investment while offering {SAV} services at \$1.00 per mile for a non-shared trip (which is less than a third of Austin’s average taxi cab fare).},

	abstract = {Taxi is certainly the most popular type of on-demand transportation service in urban areas because taxi-dispatching systems offer more and better services in terms of shorter wait times and passenger travel convenience. However, a shortage of taxicabs has always been critical in many urban contexts especially during peak hours, and taxi has great potential to maximize its efficiency by employing the shared-ride concept. There are recent successes in dynamic ride-sharing projects that are expected to bring substantial benefits arising from energy consumption and operation efficiency and thus, it is essential to develop advanced shared-taxi-dispatch algorithms and investigate the collective benefits of dynamic ride-sharing by maximizing occupancy and minimizing travel times in real-time. This article investigates how taxi services can be improved by proposing shared-taxi algorithms and what type of objective functions and constraints could be employed to prevent excessive passenger detours. Hybrid-simulated annealing ({HSA}) is applied to dynamically assign passenger requests efficiently. A series of simulations are conducted with two different taxi operation strategies. The simulation results reveal that allowing ride-sharing for taxicabs increases productivity over the various demand levels and {HSA} can be considered as a suitable solution to maximize the system efficiency of dynamic ride-sharing.},

	abstract = {Today, driverless cars, as a new technology that allows a more accessible, dynamic and intelligent form of Shared Mobility, are expected to revolutionize urban transportation. One of the conceivable mobility services based on driverless cars is shared autonomous vehicles ({SAVs}). This service could merge cabs, carsharing, and ridesharing systems into a singular transportation mode. However, the success and competitiveness of future {SAV} services depend on their operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration and fleet specification. In addition, any change in operational models will result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of {SAV} simulation in a multimodal dynamic demand system with integrated {SAV} user taste variation, this study evaluates the performance of various {SAV} fleets and vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. Also, the impact of ridesharing and rebalancing strategies on service performance is investigated. Research results suggest that the performance of {SAV} is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing scheme proposed in this study (i.e., 20\% lower for ridesharing scenario), the standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all scenarios. The results also underline that enabling vehicle-rebalancing strategies may have an important effect on both user and servicerelated metrics. The estimated {SAV} average and maximum driven distance prove the importance of vehicle range and charging station deployment.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in Mobility-on-Demand ({MoD}) systems have demonstrated the potential of road vehicles as an efficient mode of urban transportation Newly developed algorithms can compute vehicle routes in real-time for batches of requests and allow for multiple requests to share vehicles. These algorithms have primarily focused on optimally producing vehicle schedules to pick up and drop off requests. The redistribution of idle vehicles to areas of high demand, known as rebalancing, on the contrary has received little attention in the context of ride-sharing. In this paper, we present a method to rebalance idle vehicles in a ride-sharing enabled {MoD} fleet. This method consists of an algorithm to optimally partition the fleet operating area into rebalancing regions, an algorithm to determine a real-time demand estimate for every region using incoming requests, and an algorithm to optimize the assignment of idle vehicles to these rebalancing regions using an integer linear program. Evaluation with historical taxi data from Manhattan shows that we can service 99.8\% of taxi requests in Manhattan using 3000 vehicles with an average waiting time of 57.4 seconds and an average in-car delay of 13.7 seconds. Moreover, we can achieve a higher service rate using 2000 vehicles than prior work achieved with 3000. Furthermore, with a fleet of 3000 vehicles, we reduce the average travel delay by 86\%, the average waiting time by 37\%, and the amount of ignored requests by 95\% compared to earlier work at the expense of an increased distance travelled by the fleet.},

However, in reality, the large majority of users request individual rides (and not pooled rides) in existing on-demand services, leading to increases in motorised vehicle miles travelled. In this study, we investigate to what extent fare discounts, additional travel time, and the (un)willingness to share the ride with (different numbers of) other passengers play a role in the decision of individuals to share rides. To this end, we design a stated preference study targeting Dutch urban individuals. In our research, we (1) disentangle the sharing aspect from related time–cost trade-offs (e.g. detours), (2) investigate preference heterogeneity regarding the studied attributes and identify distinct market segments, and (3) simulate scenarios to understand the impact of the obtained parameters in the breakdown between individual and pooled services. We find that less than one third of respondents have strong preferences against sharing their rides. Also, we find that different market segments vary not only in their values of the willingness to share, but also in how they perceive this willingness to share (per-ride or proportional to the in-vehicle time). Further, the scenario analysis demonstrates that the share of individuals who are willing to share rides depends primarily on the time–cost trade-offs, rather than on the disutility stemming from pooling rides per se.},

In order to obtain a deeper understanding of travelers’ preferences concerning a ridepooling system, choice-based Conjoint Analysis was performed. Based on a literature review and a focus group, six relevant attributes of the operational concept of ridepooling systems were determined: fare, walking distance, time of booking, shift of departure time, travel time, and information provision. Data from 237 German city dwellers were analyzed with the help of Cox regression. Except for time of booking, all service attributes significantly affected the respondents’ choice. Besides the high relevance of fare, the results underline the particular importance of the attribute walking distance to the pick-up point for elderly.

	abstract = {Ride Parcel Pooling ({RPP}) is the integrated transportation of passengers and parcels. It builds on what's known as on-demand ride-pooling, which dynamically assigns customer trips to fleet vehicles in real time, sharing their rides, and thus aiming to save on driving distances and fleet size compared to on-demand ride-hailing services. In the case of {RPP}, a additional parcel demand is introduced that is less sensitive to longer travel and waiting times and is less negatively affected by changing vehicles. In this case, parcels are served with a lower priority than passengers and simply ride along with appropriate passenger trips. This makes it possible to achieve a more efficient use of vehicle capacity and further reduce the total distance traveled for passenger and logistics mobility. This research is divided into a conceptual and scenario definition part to define the proposed service and develop possible operational scenarios, a theoretical simulation-based approach to quantify the potential of the proposed {RPP} service, and a practical field test to investigate its real-world applicability. Agent-based {RPP} simulations show that the integration of logistics services into a ride-pooling service is possible and can exploit unused system capacity without degrading passenger service. Depending on the assignment strategies, parcels can be served up to a parcel-to-passenger demand ratio of 1:10, while total fleet kilometers can be reduced compared to the status quo, as the additional mileage for logistics service can be fully integrated. In the base scenario of the simulation, approximately 50,000 passengers and 5,000 parcels are transported by a fleet of 600 cars or 1,200 rickshaws. The {RPP} field test included a mobile phone web app and five bicycle rickshaws offering the {RPP} service in the Maxvorstadt district in Munich, Germany. Each rickshaw had two passenger seats and additional space for parcels. The service was available daily between 11:00 and 19:00 for one week and was completely free for users. The field test showed that the {RPP} service is ready to operate today and provided interesting insights into the real-world operational parameters for such a service.},

	abstract = {With ongoing developments in digitalization and advances in the field of autonomous driving, on-demand ride pooling is a mobility service with the potential to disrupt the urban mobility market. Nevertheless, to apply this kind of service successfully efficient algorithms have to be implemented for effective fleet management to exploit the benefits associated with this mobility service. Especially real time computation of finding beneficial assignments is a problem not solved for large problem sizes until today. In this study, we show the importance of using advanced algorithms by comparing a fast, but simple insertion heuristic algorithm with a state-of-the-art multi-step matching algorithm. We test the algorithms in various scenarios based on private vehicle trip {OD}-data for Munich, Germany. Results indicate that in the tested scenarios by using the multi-step algorithm up to 8\${\textbackslash}\%\$ additional requests could be served while also 10\${\textbackslash}\%\$ additional driven distance could be saved. However, computational time for finding optimal assignments in the advanced algorithm exceeds real time rather fast as problem size increases. Therefore, several aspects to reduce the computational time by decreasing redundant checks of the advanced multi step algorithm are introduced. Finally, a refined vehicle selection heuristic based on three rules is presented to furthermore reduce the computational effort. In the tested scenarios this heuristic can speed up the most cost intensive algorithm step by a factor of over 8, while keeping the number of served requests almost constant and maintaining around 70\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the driven distance saved in the system. Considering all algorithm steps, an overall speed up of 2.5 could be achieved.},

	abstract = {Among the new transportation services made possible by the introduction of automated vehicles, automated mobility-on-demand ({AMoD}) has attracted a lot of attention from both industry and researchers. {AMoD} provides a service similar to taxi or ride-sharing services, while being driverless. It is expected to attract a huge fraction of travelers currently using mass transit or private vehicles and will have a disruptive effect on urban transportation. While most studies have focused on the operational efficiency of the technology itself, our work aims to investigate its impact on urban mobility. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we present a flexible {AMoD} modeling and simulation framework developed within a multi-modal agent-based urban simulation platform ({SimMobility}). The framework allows the detailed simulation and assessment of different {AMoD} operations together with an activity-based framework that accounts for changes in demand, such as activity participation, trip making, mode, destination, or route choice decisions. Second, we focus our attention on the role of mass transit in a futuristic urban system where {AMoD} is widely available. Mass transit is already challenged by current ride-sharing services, for example, Uber and Lyft, which provide comparatively better and cheaper services. This trend will plausibly be exacerbated with the introduction of {AMoD}, which may indirectly act as a replacement to mass transit. Our simulation results show that mass transit is irreplaceable, despite the high efficiency of {AMoD}, in order to avoid congestion and maintain a sustainable urban transportation system with acceptable levels of service.},

In this paper, we introduce an approach to dynamically simulate these services within a full-stack transport simulation using an insertion-based algorithm. In a first test case, using a taxi data set from Berlin, the potential for shared rides is evaluated using a fleet of vehicles with a capacity between two and four ride requests. The simulation suggests that the overall vehicle kilometers traveled may be reduced by 15–20\%, while travel time increases can be kept at a relatively low level of less than three minutes per person. Additionally, the simulation results suggest in which areas of the city it may be the most rewarding to offer shared services.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the dial-a-ride problem of ride-sharing automated taxis ({ATs}) in an urban road network, considering the traffic congestion caused by the {ATs}. This shared automated mobility system is expected to provide a seamless door-to-door service for urban travellers, much like what the existing transportation network companies ({TNC}) do, but with decreased labour cost and more flexible relocation operations due to the vehicles’ automation. We propose an integer non-linear programming ({INLP}) model that optimizes the routing of the {ATs} to maximize the system profit, depending on dynamic travel times, which are a non-linear function of the {ATs}’ flows. It is important to involve traffic congestion in such a routing problem since for a growing number of {ATs} circulating in the city their number will lead to delays. The model is embedded within a rolling horizon framework, which divides a typical day into several horizons to deal with the real-time travel demand. In each horizon, the routing model is solved with the demand at that interval and assuring the continuity of the trips between horizons. Nevertheless, each horizon model is hard to solve given its number of constraints and decision variables. Therefore, we propose a solution approach based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, which allows identifying a near-optimal solution for this difficult problem. Numerical experiments for the city of Delft, The Netherlands, are used to demonstrate the solution quality of the proposed algorithm as well as obtaining insights about the {AT} system performance. Results show that the solution algorithm can solve the proposed model for hard instances. Ride-sharing makes the {AT} system more capable to provide better service regarding delay time and the number of requests that can be attended by the system. The delay penalty on the profit objective function is an effective control parameter on guaranteeing the service quality while maintaining system profitability.},

	abstract = {Shared mobility-on-demand systems can improve the efficiency of urban mobility through reduced vehicle ownership and parking demand. However, some issues in their implementations remain open, most notably the issue of rebalancing non-occupied vehicles to meet geographically uneven demand, as is, for example, the case during the rush hour. This is somewhat alleviated by the prospect of autonomous mobility-on-demand systems, where autonomous vehicles can relocate themselves; however, the proposed relocation strategies are still centralized and assume all vehicles are a part of the same fleet. Furthermore, ride-sharing is not considered, which also has an impact on rebalancing, as already occupied vehicles can also potentially be available to serve new requests simultaneously. In this paper we propose a reinforcement learning-based decentralized approach to vehicle relocation as well as ride request assignment in shared mobility-on-demand systems. Each vehicle autonomously learns its behaviour, which includes both rebalancing and selecting which requests to serve, based on its local current and observed historical demand. We evaluate the approach using data on taxi use in New York City, first serving a single request by a vehicle at a time, and then introduce ride-sharing to evaluate its impact on the learnt rebalancing and assignment behaviour.},

The sharing economy has already transformed ridesharing, bicycle-sharing, and electric scooters, with shared autonomous vehicles ({SAVs}) poised to reshape car ownership. This study pursues two objectives: firstly, to establish a market segmentation for shared ride services and secondly, to evaluate the environmental impact of ridesharing in different contexts. To mitigate potential biases linked to stated preference data, we analysed the navette service, utilized by a research institute in Europe, closely resembling future {SAVs}. The market segmentation relied on hierarchical cluster analysis using employee survey responses, while the environmental analysis was grounded in the 2019 navette service data. Our analysis revealed four unique employee clusters: Cluster 1, emphasizing active transportation and environmental awareness; Cluster 2, showing openness towards {SAVs} given reliable alternatives are available; Cluster 3, the largest segment, highlighting a demand for policy support and superior service quality; and Cluster 4, which places a premium on time, suggesting a potential need for strategies to make the service more efficient and, consequently, discourage private car use. These findings highlight a general willingness to adopt shared transport modes, signalling a promising transition to shared vehicle ownership with significant environmental benefits achievable through service design and policy measures. © 2024 by the authors.},

Highly flexible, but very costly direct transportation is often offered as a complement to standard fixed route public transport service. In the integrated dial-a-ride problem ({IDARP}), these modes of transport are combined and certain legs of the passengers journeys may be performed with the fixed route public transport system. We extend the {IDARP} and include timetables for the fixed route services, forcing the fleet of vehicles to schedule the arrival at transfer locations with care. Two mixed integer linear programming formulations of the integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetables are presented and analyzed. The key modeling challenge is that of the transfers between the fleet of vehicles and the fixed route public transport system. The formulations differ in how the transfers are modeled and the differences are thoroughly discussed. The computational study compares the formulations in terms of network size, computational time and memory usage and conclusions about their performances are drawn.},

A transportation planning is supposed to be time consistent if for each passenger, the same service time is used all along the planning horizon. However, considering the numerous variations in transportation demands over a week, designing consistent plans for all passengers can be too expensive. It is therefore necessary to find a compromise solution between costs and time-consistency objectives. The time-consistent dial-a-ride problem is solved using an epsilon-constraint approach to illustrate the trade-off between these two objectives. It computes an approximation of the Pareto front, using a matheuristic framework that combines a large neighbourhood search with the solution of set partitioning problems. This approach is benchmarked on time-consistent vehicle routing problem literature instances. Experiments are also conducted in the context of door-to-door transportation for people with disabilities, using real data. These experiments support managerial insights regarding the inter-relatedness of costs and quality of service.},

It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-ﬁeld. Over its lifespan the {VRP} literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difﬁcult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to trafﬁc management. Consequently, this paper deﬁnes {VRP}’s domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the {VRP} literature, and delineates all of {VRP}’s facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classiﬁed to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published {VRP} taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the {VRP} literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the {VRP} literature.},

We use this model to study the implications it has for such services and investigate whether it has a distinct cost advantage and operational improvement. We develop a dynamic pricing scheme that utilizes a balking rule that incorporates socially eﬃcient level and the revenue-maximizing price, and an equilibrium-joining threshold obtained by imposing a toll on the customers who join the system. Results of numerical simulations based on actual New York City taxicab data indicate that a competitive on-demand mobility system supported by the proposed model increases the social welfare by up to 37\% on average compared to the single-server queuing system. The study oﬀers a novel design scheme and supporting tools for more eﬀective budget/resource allocation, planning, and operation management of ﬂexible transit systems.},

The problem variant we consider aims at finding a set of minimum-cost routes satisfying constraints on vehicle capacity, time windows, maximum route duration, and maximum user ride times. We propose an adaptive large neighborhood search ({ALNS}) for its solution. The key novelty of the approach is an exact amortized constant-time algorithm for evaluating the feasibility of request insertions in the repair steps of the {ALNS}. In addition, we use two optional improvement techniques: a local-search-based intraroute improvement of routes of promising solutions using the Balas–Simonetti neighborhood and the solution of a set covering model over a subset of all routes generated during the search. With these techniques, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality. New best solutions are found for several benchmark instances.

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate an extension of the R-{DARP} recently proposed by [Liu M, Luo Z, Lim A (2015) A branch-and-cut algorithm for a realistic dial-a-ride problem. Transporation Res. Part B: Methodological 81(1):267–288.]. The R-{DARP}, as a variant of the classic dial-a-ride problem ({DARP}), consists of determining a set of minimum-distance trips for vehicles to transport a set of clients from their origins to their destinations, subject to side constraints, such as capacity constraints, time window constraints, maximum riding time constraints, and manpower planning constraints. Our problem extends the R-{DARP} by (1) changing its objective to first maximizing the number of requests satisfied and then minimizing the total travel distance of the vehicles, and (2) generalizing the lunch break constraints of staff members. To solve this problem, we propose a two-phase branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm based on a strong trip-based model. The trip-based model is built on a set of nondominated trips, which are enumerated by an ad hoc label-setting algorithm in the first phase. Then we decompose the trip-based model by Benders decomposition and propose a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm to solve the decomposed model in the second phase. Our two-phase exact algorithm is tested on the R-{DARP} benchmark instances and a set of new instances generated according to the same real-world data set as the R-{DARP} instances. Our algorithm quickly solves all of the R-{DARP} instances to optimality and outperforms the branch-and-cut proposed by Liu, Luo, and Lim. On the 42 new test instances, our algorithm solves 27 instances to optimality in four hours with the largest instance consisting of 36 requests.

	abstract = {Ridepooling is expected to become more and more important in people’s mobility. At the same time, autonomous vehicles are expected to be widely used in such applications in the future. While the driver as a person of trust currently provides security, passengers are alone with strangers in an autonomous ridepooling vehicle. In the paper, we address this aspect by including incompatibilities between customers, meaning that incompatible customers cannot share the vehicle at the same time. Although incompatibilities can be defined in any way by the provider, they can be set, for example, if a customer feels unsafe in sharing the vehicle with customers of a certain type. As other compatible customers can replace the driver as a person of trust, we present a second setting where all customers are allowed to share the vehicle at the same time, but customers are never alone in the vehicle with incompatible customers. We present Branch-and-Cut algorithms for both problem settings including methods to improve the search with respect to the incompatibilities. We show in a computational study that the introduced methods improve the search significantly and evaluate the Branch-and-Cut algorithms on realistic instances with up to 120 customers and 10 vehicles. Moreover, our results suggest that it can be a beneficial option for the provider to allow their customers to participate in the decision process by indicating incompatibilities for types of customers, meaning that they do not want to share a vehicle with a customer of an incompatible type.},

Therefore, they are amongst others in competition with taxis and private cars, which makes a more customer-oriented objective necessary. We present an adaptive large neighbourhood search ({ALNS}) as well as a dynamic programming algorithm ({DP}), which are tested in comprehensive computational studies. Although the {DP} can only be used for a single tour and, due to the computational effort, as a restricted version or for small instances, the {ALNS} also works efficiently for larger instances.

A fleet of demand-responsive transit vehicles with such technology can serve passengers door to door or have vehicles deviate to platoon with each other to travel at lower cost and allow for en-route passenger transfers before splitting. A mixed integer linear programming ({MILP}) model is formulated to solve this “modular dial-a-ride problem” ({MDARP}). A heuristic algorithm based on Steiner-tree-inspired large neighborhood search is developed to solve the {MDARP} for practical scenarios. A set of small-scale synthetic numerical experiments are tested to evaluate the optimality gap and computation time between exact solutions of the {MDARP} using commercial software and the proposed heuristic. Large-scale experiments are conducted on the Anaheim network with up to 75 vehicles and 150 requests considering 378 candidate join/split nodes to further explore the potentials and identify the ideal operation scenarios of {MVs}. The results show that {MV} technology can save up to 52\% in vehicle travel cost, 41\% in passenger service time, and 29\% in total cost against existing on-demand mobility services in the scenarios tested. Results suggest that {MVs} best benefit from platooning by serving “enclave pairs” as a hub-and-spoke service.},

	abstract = {The problem considered in this work stems from a non-proﬁt organization in charge of door-to-door passenger transportation for medical appointments. Patients are picked up at home by a driver and are then dropped at their appointment location. They may also be driven back home at the end of their appointment. Some patients have speciﬁc requirements, e.g., they may require an accompanying person or a wheelchair. Planning such activities gives rise to a so-called dial-a-ride problem. In the present work, it is assumed that the requests assigned to the drivers have been selected, and the transportation plan has been established for the next day. However, in practice, appointment durations may vary due to unforeseen circumstances, and some transportation requests may be modiﬁed, delayed or canceled during the day. The aim of this work is to propose a reactive algorithm which can adapt the initial plan in order to manage the disruptions and to take care of as many patients as possible in real-time. The plan should be modiﬁed quickly when a perturbation is observed, without resorting to major changes which may confuse the drivers and the patients. Several recourse procedures are deﬁned for this purpose. They allow the dispatcher to temporarily delete a request, to insert a previously deleted request, or to permanently cancel a request. Simulation techniques are used to test the approach on randomly generated scenarios. Several key performance indicators are introduced in order to measure the impact of the disruptions and the quality of the solutions.},

Despite the advancements in vehicular technologies, vehicle breakdown ({VB}) remains one of the major contributors to the disruption of fleet operations, which may inflict large recovery costs and damage the service provider?s reputation. However, modeling such dynamic events for dial-a-ride ({DAR}) systems has not been addressed until now; this is the research gap we attempt to address in this article. The following are the contributions of our work: 1) the formulation of a disruptive {DAR} problem ({DDARP}) with {VB} ({DDARP}-{VB}), 2) a {GPU}-based adaptive large neighborhood search (G-{ALNS}) algorithm to solve the {DDARP}-{VB}, and 3) a fleet size minimization ({FSM}) strategy that leads to reduced operational costs under disruptions. From our simulations, the proposed G-{ALNS} algorithm performs up to 52 times faster than its {CPU} counterpart and produces better solutions when compared to the existing {GPU} approach for {DARPs}. Overall, our {FSM} strategy leads to a 59\% reduction in fleet idle time under normal operations and a 15\% reduction in operational cost under disruption.},

            An important but difficult combinatorial problem, in general, is to find the optimal route for a single vehicle on a given network. This paper defines a problem type, called the General Routing Problem, and gives an algorithm for its solution. The classical Traveling Salesman Problem and the Chinese Postman Problem are shown to be special limiting cases of the General Routing Problem. The algorithm provides a unified approach to both node and arc oriented routing problems, and exploits special properties of most real transportation networks such as sparsity of the associated adjacency matrix, and the tendency for arc symmetry at many nodes. For node oriented routing problems, this approach tends to produce large reduction in effective problem size.},

	abstract = {An investigation of the single-vehicle, many-to-many, immediate-request dial-a-ride problem is developed in two parts (I and {II}). Part I focuses on the "static" case of the problem. In this case, intermediate requests that may appear during the execution of the route are not considered. A generalized objective function is examined, the minimization of a weighted combination of the time to service all customers and of the total degree of "dissatisfaction" experienced by them while waiting for service. This dissatisfaction is assumed to be a linear function of the waiting and riding times of each customer. Vehicle capacity constraints and special priority rules are part of the problem. A Dynamic Programming approach is developed. The algorithm exhibits a computational effort which, although an exponential function of the size of the problem, is asymptotically lower than the corresponding effort of the classical Dynamic Programming algorithm applied to a Traveling Salesman Problem of the same size. Part {II} extends this approach to solving the equivalent "dynamic" case. In this case, new customer requests are automatically eligible for consideration at the time they occur. The procedure is an open-ended sequence of updates, each following every new customer request. The algorithm optimizes only over known inputs and does not anticipate future customer requests. Indefinite deferment of a customer's request is prevented by the priority rules introduced in Part I. Examples in both "static" and "dynamic" cases are presented.},

We look at two types of mobility services, private and shared. Our problem extends the dynamic {DARP} by (i) changing its objective function to profit maximization, where both cost and revenue are variables, and (ii) incorporating assortment optimization with routing decisions in a dynamic setting. We propose a pricing scheme based on a choice model designed to offer service alternatives at the time a customer makes a request.

We propose different anticipatory algorithms and investigate which algorithm performs best according to the given settings in a real-world application. We therefore address different types of dynamic events, appropriate response times, and the synchronization of real-world data with the plan. In order to test and analyze how the algorithms behave and perform, we apply the concept of a digital twin. The implemented anticipatory algorithms compared here are a sample scenario planning approach and two waiting strategies. The question of the value of more sophisticated algorithms compared to algorithms with less computational effort is investigated. The experimental results show that solution quality beneﬁts from incorporating information about future requests, and that simple waiting strategies prove most suitable for such a highly dynamic environment. We ﬁnd that in highly stochastic environments, a rescheduling should be done whenever a new event occurs, whereas in less stochastic environments it is better to let the optimization engine run a bit longer and not start reoptimization after every new event.},

	abstract = {This study is inspired by a challenging dynamic Dial-a-Ride Problem ({DARP}) encountered in a mobility service operated by the company Padam.1 . Customers ask for a transportation service either in advance or in real-time and get an immediate answer about whether their requests are accepted or rejected. The main goal is to maximize the number of accepted requests during the service while respecting maximum capacity of limited number of vehicles. In this study, we propose novel methods based on reinsertion techniques to improve Padam’s online system. The proposed reinsertion techniques aim to exploit the neighborhood of a solution and must be run in real-time whenever a request is rejected by an online system. Three main online reinsertion heuristics based on different neighborhoods are proposed. The first heuristic called {HDR} uses destruction and repair operators, the second heuristic called {GH} (graph heuristic) uses the ejection chain concept, and allow modeling the reinsertion problem as a constrained shortest path problem on directed graph built from a current solution, and the third heuristic called {IGH} (improved graph heuristic) based on {GH} with intensive exploration of the neighborhood. Our proposed approaches were extensively tested on real and hard instances provided by Padam. These instances contain up to 1011 requests and 14 vehicles and with very tight time windows. The obtained results revealed the performance of the proposed reinsertion methods compared to the online heuristic, where the number of served requests is increased and the number of vehicles is reduced while maintaining operating costs close to those of the online system. The results confirm the interest of using reinsertion techniques in the dynamic {DARP} service.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a bi-objective mathematical optimization model and a two-stage heuristic for a real-world application of the heterogeneous Dynamic Dial-a-Ride Problem with no rejects, i.e., a patient transportation system. The problem consists of calculating route plans to meet a set of transportation requests by using a given heterogeneous vehicle fleet. These transportation requests can be either static or dynamic, and all of them must be attended to. In the first stage of the proposed heuristic, the problem’s static part is solved by applying a General Variable neighborhood Search based algorithm. In the second stage, the dynamic requests are dealt with by implementing a simple insertion heuristic. We create different instances based on the real data provided by a Brazilian city’s public health care system and test the proposed approach on them. The analysis of the results shows that the higher the level of dynamism, i.e., the number of urgent requests on each instance, the smaller the objective function value will be in the static part. The results also demonstrate that a higher level of dynamism increases the chance of a time window violation happening. Besides, we use the weighted sum method of the two conflicting objectives to analyze the trade-off between them and create an approximation for the Pareto frontier.},

	abstract = {The Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem (E-{ADARP}) consists in scheduling a fleet of electric autonomous vehicles to provide ride-sharing services for customers that specify their origins and destinations. The E-{ADARP} considers the following perspectives: (i) a weightedsum objective that minimizes both total travel time and total excess user ride time; (ii) the employment of electric autonomous vehicles and a partial recharging policy. This paper presents the first labeling algorithm for a path-based formulation of the {DARP}/E-{ADARP}, where the main ingredient includes: (1) fragment-based representation of paths, (2) a novel approach that abstracts fragments to arcs while ensuring excess-user-ride-time optimality, (3) construction of a sparser new graph with the abstracted arcs, which is proven to preserve all feasible routes of the original graph, and (4) strong dominance rules and constant-time feasibility checks to compute the shortest paths efficiently. This labeling algorithm is then integrated into Branchand-Price (B\&P) algorithms to solve the E-{ADARP}. In the computational experiments, the B\&P algorithm achieves optimality in 71 out of 84 instances. Remarkably, among these instances, 50 were solved optimally at the root node without branching. We identify 26 new best solutions, improve 30 previously reported lower bounds, and provide 17 new lower bounds for large-scale instances with up to 8 vehicles and 96 requests. In total 42 new best solutions are generated on previously solved and unsolved instances. In addition, we analyze the impact of incorporating the total excess user ride time within the objectives and allowing unlimited visits to recharging stations. The following managerial insights are provided: (1) solving a weighted-sum objective function can significantly enhance the service quality, while still maintaining operational costs at nearly optimal levels, (2) the relaxation on charging visits allows us to solve all instances feasibly and further reduces the average solution cost.},

While the optimization of {DDARPs} has been extensively examined, these analyses often focus solely on economic decisions. The recent literature emphasizes the inclusion of social and environmental factors in addition to economic considerations for a sustainable transportation system. This paper provides a conceptual review that identifies and classifies the most common {DDARP} objectives in the three dimensions of the Triple-Bottom-Line (3BL) approach of sustainability: environmental, economic, and social. This study analyzes the interconnections among different objectives and provides insights into multi-objective approaches used in transportation problems. The findings demonstrate the interconnectedness of objectives from different dimensions and highlight the involvement of various stakeholders in decision-making. The results show that optimizing one objective may have implications for other objectives, suggesting a trade-off to be considered. The results reveal that social objectives boost the economic dimension by improving service quality; however, environmental objectives negatively impact the economic dimension. Additionally, a geographical analysis was conducted, which revealed continent-wise variations in research focus and contributions. Future studies should focus more on the social and environmental dimensions to promote a sustainable transportation system.},

	abstract = {Transportation planning has been established as a key topic in the literature and social production practices. An increasing number of researchers are studying vehicle routing problems ({VRPs}) and their variants considering real-life applications and scenarios. Furthermore, with the rapid growth in the processing speed and memory capacity of computers, various algorithms can be used to solve increasingly complex instances of {VRPs}. In this study, we analyzed recent literature published between 2019 and August of 2021 using a taxonomic framework. We reviewed recent research according to models and solutions, and divided models into three categories of customer-related, vehicle-related, and depot-related models. We classified solution algorithms into exact, heuristic, and meta-heuristic algorithms. The main contribution of our study is a classification table that is available online as Appendix A. This classification table should enable future researchers to find relevant literature easily and provide readers with recent trends and solution methodologies in the field of {VRPs} and some well-known variants.},

	abstract = {Vehicle routing problems have been the focus of extensive research over the past sixty years, driven by their economic importance and their theoretical interest. The diversity of applications has motivated the study of a myriad of problem variants with different attributes. In this article, we provide a concise overview of existing and emerging problem variants. Models are typically reﬁned along three lines: considering more relevant objectives and performance metrics, integrating vehicle routing evaluations with other tactical decisions, and capturing ﬁne-grained yet essential aspects of modern supply chains. We organize the main problem attributes within this structured framework. We discuss recent research directions and pinpoint current shortcomings, recent successes, and emerging challenges.},
