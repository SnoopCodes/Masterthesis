While demand-responsive transport is sometimes prescribed as an innovative strategy for service provision, the network planning approach to public transport suggests that integrated timed-transfer or pulse timetable networks should be explored first. This paper examines the rural network approach using examples from Switzerland, which has among the highest rates of public transport use in Western Europe, as well as nationally-coordinated Taktfahrplan scheduling that extends deep into rural areas. The basic Swiss pulse timetabling technique is reviewed, along with the application of the approach to a remote rural case study in Graubünden’s Lower Engadine and Val Müstair. Characteristics of pulse timetable networks and the wider rural network approach are considered, drawing broad lessons for their potential application elsewhere.;01.11.16;31.07.25 13:41;31.07.25 13:41;31.07.25 13:41;175-185;;;52;;Transport Policy;Watching the Swiss;;;;;;;;;;;;ScienceDirect;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/9AL7BZ8J/Petersen - 2016 - Watching the Swiss A network approach to rural and exurban public transport.pdf;;;"Demand-responsive; Integrated timed-transfer; Network planning; Pulse timetable; Rural public transport; Taktfahrplan";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper provides a historical overview of DRT experiences, understanding their pros and cons. In addition, it presents the case study of Mokumflex, a 12-month DRT pilot program that replaced the regular bus service in low-density areas of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Based on a close collaboration with the private enterprise that operated the service and also with the local bus operator, we performed an empirical before and after comparison. These insights help to understand the impacts of DRT systems and support (future) design of DRT and public transport. A set of indicators was chosen for the intermodal comparison: travel distances, ridership, costs, Greenhouse Gases (GHG), emissions and population's perception. Ridership dropped from 78.1 passengers/day to 15.9 passengers/day, however, for being “demand-tailored”, passenger-km reduced even more, going from 1252.8 km/day to 136.6 km/day, hence reducing the costs and GHG emissions per passenger. In regards to population's perception, the system enjoyed a good evaluation.;01.11.20;31.07.25 13:45;31.07.25 13:45;31.07.25 13:45;100910;;;83;;Research in Transportation Economics;Impacts of replacing a fixed public transport line by a demand responsive transport system;Thredbo 16 conference;;;;;;;;;;;ScienceDirect;;;;"/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/2TDYDZTJ/1-s2.0-S0739885920301086-main.pdf; /Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/DZNUGTE4/Coutinho et al. - 2020 - Impacts of replacing a fixed public transport line by a demand responsive transport system Case stu.pdf; /Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/U4FUHW7Z/S0739885920301086.html";;;"Demand responsive transport; Efficient operations; Fixed public transport; Ridership; Sustainability";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It adopts a ‘rural’ definition of settlements under a population of 10,000.Evidence from the National Travel Survey, technical press reports and academic work is brought together to examine the overall picture.Inter-urban services between towns can provide a cost-effective way of serving rural areas where smaller settlements are suitably located. The cost structures of both fixed-route and demand-responsive services indicate that staff time and cost associated with vehicle provision are the main elements. Demand-responsive services may enable larger areas to be covered, to meet planning objectives of ensuring a minimum of level of service, but experience often shows high unit cost and public expenditure per passenger trip. Economic evaluation indicates user benefits per passenger trip of similar magnitude to existing average public expenditure per trip on fixed-route services. Considerable scope exists for improvements to conventional services through better marketing and service reliability.The main issue in England is the level of funding for rural services in general, and the importance attached to serving those without access to cars in such areas.The boundary between fixed-route and demand-responsive operation may lie at relatively low population densities.The chapter uses statistical data, academic research and operator experience of enhanced conventional bus services to provide a synthesis of outcomes in rural areas.;07.10.16;31.07.25 13:48;31.07.25 13:48;31.07.25 13:48;0;;;8;;;;;;;;Emerald Group Publishing Limited;;;;;;;Silverchair;;DOI: 10.1108/S2044-994120160000008015;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/2JMVTLGC/2016 - The Roles of ‘Conventional’ and Demand-Responsive Bus Services.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They are one of the most important factors contributing to economic prosperity as they provide access to mobility for all the inhabitants of these regions. Maintaining such rural public transport lines can be a challenge due to the low utilization inherent to rural areas. Today, with the emergence of fully self-driving cars, on-demand mobility schemes in which autonomous robotic taxis transport passengers, are becoming possible. In this work, we analyze if rural public transport lines with low utilization can be replaced with autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. More specifically, we compare the existing public transportation infrastructure to hypothetical mobility-on-demand systems both in terms of cost and service level. We perform our analysis, which focuses on the operational aspects, using a simulation approach in which unit-capacity robotic taxis are operated in a street network taking into account congestion effects and state-of-the-art control (dispatching and rebalancing) strategies. Our study considers the case of four rural train lines in Switzerland that operate at low utilization and cost coverage. We show that a unit-capacity mobility-on-demand service with selfdriving cars reduces both travel times and operational cost in three out of four cases. In one case, even a service with human driven vehicles would provide higher service levels at lower cost. The results suggest that centrally coordinated mobility-on-demand schemes could be a very attractive option for rural areas.;2020-04;31.07.25 13:53;31.07.25 13:53;31.07.25 13:53;35-51;;;134;;;Improved public transportation in rural areas with self-driving cars;;;;;;;en;https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/;;;;Crossref;;Publisher: Elsevier BV;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/8CKWBMAR/Sieber et al. - 2020 - Improved public transportation in rural areas with self-driving cars A study on the operation of Sw.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The performance measures included availability, comfort and convenience, waiting time, mobility, productivity and safety. The data used in this research was collected from three sources: field survey of existing bus routes, operational data from Land Transport Regulatory Commission and questionnaire surveys which were distributed to a sample of passengers and bus drivers. The obtained data was used to compute the performance measures, as well as to develop statistical models to estimate the average waiting time of buses at peak and off-peak hours. The results indicated that the waiting time at off-peak hours was two and a half times the waiting time at peak hours. It was found that 40% of the external bus routes were within the range of overall Level of Service (LOS) C & D, 26.67% between B & D, 13.33% between B & C, 13.33% between C & E and 6.67% between D & E. Also, it was found that 60% of internal bus routes’ LOSs were between C & D, 20% between C & E and 20% with LOS C. It was found that the average perceived waiting time depends on the total travel time regardless of on-peak or off-peak trips.

Rural areas’ low demand, the distance among settlements, and an older population on average make conventional public transportation inefficient and costly. This paper assesses the contribution that on-demand mobility has the potential to make to rural areas. First, demand-responsive transportation is described, and the related literature is reviewed to gather existing system configurations. Next, we describe and implement a proposal and test it on a simulation basis. The results show a clear potential of the demand-responsive mobility paradigm to serve rural demand at an acceptable quality of service. Finally, the results are discussed, and the issues of adoption rate and input data scarcity are addressed.;2024;31.07.25 14:09;31.07.25 14:09;31.07.25 14:09;245-267;;1;21;;ComSIS;;;;;;;;en;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/;;;;Crossref;;Publisher: National Library of Serbia;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/WU8EDFGS/Martí et al. - 2024 - A flexible approach for demand-responsive public transport in rural areas.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditionally, planning of rural feeder service has been carried out without due consideration to indirect costs associated with hard factors (e.g., walking distance and waiting time) and soft factors (e.g., crowding inside vehicles) of the service. A case study is presented for the planning of rural feeder service with due consideration to direct and indirect costs to users and operational viability of the service. Direct and indirect costs to users are expressed in terms of a comprehensive measure called generalized cost (GC). GC is developed on the basis of the willingness to pay (WTP) of rural commuters with respect to various attributes of rural feeder service. The work demonstrates the effect of catchment characteristics (i.e., number of villages, size of villages, and spatial separation represented by road network connecting villages to bus stop) on feeder service attributes (i.e., type of vehicle, route, headway of service and fare). It is also shown that planning of feeder service could be instrumental in bringing benefits to rural communities. The results presented in the paper are case specific, but the methodology can be applied to the planning of feeder services in other rural regions.

An efficient public transportation system will contribute towards sustainable economic growth and healthy social development of the district, which, in turn, will ensure human security in respect of the mobility of goods and services for today’s and future needs. However, limited studies that analyse the service gap and local demand for the public bus service in Peninsular Malaysia have been conducted. The improvement in bus service reliability depends on several parameters including the route coverage and schedule. This study presents an empirical analysis of the fixed-route hour level of service (LOS) for urban and rural bus services to understand the level of reliability and quality of the service provided. A field survey was conducted to collect the secondary data concerning the bus routes and schedules from the local bus operators. Through a sampling survey of bus lines in selected urban and rural settlements in Peninsular Malaysia, service reliability based on the fixed-route hour service is evaluated. A total of nine (9) bus companies with a total of 48 routes were selected to represent nine (9) bus terminals operating in Johor, Penang, Pahang and Perak. Johor represents the southern states, while Penang represents the northern states. For the east-coast states, Pahang is selected, while Perak represents a still developing state, which is yet to reach the advanced level of large conurbations. The distance of a bus route from the origin to the destination is also analysed. A standard service quality measure is referred to in determining the level of service (LOS) and for identifying the service disparities between urban and rural settlements. The results indicate that the LOS for the fixed-route hour of bus services in the rural areas range from C to D and B to E in the urban settlement. The recommendations put forward include the improvement of real-time scheduling of buses, expansion of service hours and revised fare systems to ensure the future sustainability of the urban and rural bus services in Malaysia.;2018;31.07.25 14:21;31.07.25 14:21;31.07.25 14:21;189-201;;;;;;Assessing Disparities in the Urban-Rural Service;;;;;Springer;Singapore;en;;;;;Springer Link;;DOI: 10.1007/978-981-10-5433-4_13;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/8KH6BG6J/McLellan - 2018 - Sustainable Future for Human Security.pdf;;;;McLellan, Benjamin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The employment of internet of things (IoT) technologies has proven to be a valid response to mobility challenges in rural areas, and has brought up the concept of “smart land”. Framed within the context of the Interreg Central Europe project RUMOBIL, this study tries to shed light on how the deployment of smart mobility solutions within the rural context compare to that within the urban context. Following a literature review, we compared the ease of implementation of different IoT solutions on the urban and the rural contexts, for planners, travellers, and operators, and the relative complexity of common smart mobility issues. In addition, we identiﬁed three major challenges for both rural and urban mobility, namely the need for standardized metrics for optimal routes' detection and a dynamic deﬁnition of optimal route, as well as the simpliﬁcation of investments' planning and programming. Both smart cities and smart land can beneﬁt from smart mobility solutions, even if in most cases, each of the two contexts can gain more advantages than the other from the same solution. Even considering the different levels of population scattering, technological infrastructures, social maturity, and economic opportunities, both rural and urban areas offer comparable advantages. For the future of transport, it is up to all policy levels to consider the challenges deriving from expected trends and leverage the untapped potential of IoT technologies to satisfy future travellers’ needs and ensure sustainability.;2020-02;31.07.25 14:26;31.07.25 14:26;31.07.25 14:26;88-97;;1;7;;;Smart mobility and public transport;;;;;;;en;https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/;;;;Crossref;;Publisher: Elsevier BV;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/SNL3KCXV/Porru et al. - 2020 - Smart mobility and public transport Opportunities and challenges in rural and urban areas.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To reduce costs, flexible and on-demand services are often proposed as alternatives for conventional bus services. Conventional services are generally not suitable for rural areas, because the demand is low and dispersed. In this paper, a stated preference survey is designed to identify the preferences of rural bus users for alternative services. Other than the traditional bus, two other modes are included in this study: a demand responsive transport (DRT) service and an express bus service with bike-sharing services for last mile transport. Given the on-demand nature of these alternatives, flexibility- and reliability-related attributes are included in the stated preference survey. The results from the choice model indicate that the reliability and flexibility aspects do not have a large effect on the preference for the on-demand alternatives. Instead, cost, access and egress times, and in-vehicle time play a bigger role in individuals? preferences toward the different alternatives. A sensitivity analysis shows that changes in the operational characteristics can make the on-demand alternatives more attractive. However, many bus users still prefer the conventional bus service over the on-demand alternatives.;01.12.21;31.07.25 15:20;31.07.25 15:20;31.07.25 15:20;524-533;;12;2675;;;Preferences toward Bus Alternatives in Rural Areas of the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;;;;SAGE Journals;;Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/EIT8AEAG/Bronsvoort et al. - 2021 - Preferences toward Bus Alternatives in Rural Areas of the Netherlands A Stated Choice Experiment.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Transport is also crucial to connect remote areas to central or urban areas. Yet, sustainable and flexible transport is among the greatest challenges for rural areas and rural–urban regions. Innovative transport concepts and approaches are urgently needed to foster sustainable and integrated regional development. This article addresses challenges of sustainability, accessibility, and connectivity through examining complementary systems to existing public transport, including demand-responsive transport and multimodal mobility. We draw upon case studies from the Metropolitan Area of Styria, Ljubljana Urban Region and rural Wales (GUSTmobil, REGIOtim, EURBAN, Bicikelj, Bwcabus, Grass Routes). In-depth analysis through a mixed-methods case study design captures the complexity behind these chosen examples, which form a basis for analysing the effects of services on accessibility for different groups, connectivity to public transport and usability as a “first and last mile” feeder. We further explore the weaknesses of complementary transport systems, including legal, organisational and financial barriers, and offer potential solutions to structure and communicate complementary transport systems to improve access and use. Looking ahead, we use the case studies to anticipate innovative, sustainable “mobility as a service” (MaaS) solutions within and between urban and rural areas and consider how future public policy orientations and arrangements can enable positive change. A main concern of our article and the contribution to scientific literature is through exploring the benefit of well-established multi-level governance arrangements when introducing smaller-scale mobility solutions to improve rural–urban accessibility. It becomes clear that not a one-size-fits-all model but placed-based and tailored approaches lead to successful and sustainable concepts.;2021-01;31.07.25 15:34;31.07.25 15:34;31.07.25 15:34;1280;;3;13;;;;;;;;;;en;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/;;;;www.mdpi.com;;Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/C96J3XWT/Bauchinger et al. - 2021 - Developing Sustainable and Flexible Rural–Urban Connectivity through Complementary Mobility Services.pdf;;;"public transport; complementary mobility; micro-public transport; mobility; multimodal mobility; rural–urban; sustainable transport";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In Japan, rural areas face sparse populations and rapid growth in the percentage of elderly people. In these areas, many bus lines offer fewer than 10 services per day. In addition to low-frequency services, it is also inconvenient to transfer to another bus or train service. Thus, there is a strong need to design a timetable that ensures smooth transfers among buses and trains. We tackle this problem by adopting existing bus lines and train timetables as much as possible to avoid drastic changes such as an increase in the number of services. Based on this approach, we present a mathematical optimization model to generate a revised bus timetable that shortens waiting time for transfers compared with the current timetable. We apply our model to a part of the Tohoku District in Japan and demonstrate its usefulness in the real world.;2020-09;31.07.25 15:43;31.07.25 15:43;31.07.25 15:43;1238-1250;;5;54;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon);;Publisher: INFORMS;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/M967PQEU/Takamatsu und Taguchi - 2020 - Bus Timetable Design to Ensure Smooth Transfers in Areas with Low-Frequency Public Transportation Se.pdf;;;"bus and railway network; event–activity network; mathematical optimization; timetable design";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Little research has been done to develop frameworks for route design. A methodology to explore the most cost-effective DFRT route is presented in this paper. The inputs include potential DFRT demand distribution and a road network. A heuristic is used to build possible routes by starting at urban cores and extending in all network directions in certain length increments. All the DFRT routes falling in the length range desired by the users are selected. The cost effectiveness of those routes, defined by operating cost per passenger trip, is compared. The most cost-effective route is selected and presented in a GIS map. A case study illustrates the methodology in several Tennessee metropolitan regions. The most cost-effective route length is case specific; some routes (e.g. those out of our Nashville case) are most cost effective when short, while others (e.g. those out of Memphis) are most cost effective when long. Government agencies could use the method to identify routes with the lowest operating cost per passenger given a route length or an operating cost budget.

The transport demand in rural areas is often low, which makes it hard to establish and run a financially sustainable public transport system. A solution is integrated passenger transport that eliminates deficiencies and provides benefits for all participants in the public passenger transport process. This paper describes the impact of integrated passenger transport on mobility in rural areas and critically evaluates different literature sources. Integration of passenger transport in urban areas has been described in the context of rural areas, and the challenges of integration of public passenger transport specific to rural areas have been analysed. Through the application in urban and rural areas, the planning of integrated and non-integrated passenger transport has been functionally analysed. The analysis found an increase in the degree of mobility in the areas that use integrated passenger transport compared to the non-integrated one. This research of the literature review has identified the rural areas of mobility as under-researched. The mobility research can set up a more efficient passenger transport planning system in rural areas.;12.11.20;31.07.25 16:04;31.07.25 16:04;31.07.25 16:04;863-873;;6;32;;PROMET;;;;;;;;en;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0;;;;Crossref;;Publisher: Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/MV8PI6GQ/Maretić und Abramović - 2020 - Integrated Passenger Transport System in Rural Areas – A Literature Review.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Case Studies in Public and Personal Interactive Systems;978-3-030-49757-6;;10.1007/978-3-030-49757-6_6;;Public transport in rural areas is currently often characterized by inadequate services, so that motorized private transport dominates these areas. This situation is considered to be unsatisfactory from an economic and social policy perspective, as it has considerable negative environmental effects. The main problems here are a decline in economic performance and an aging population as well as an increasing rural exodus. With the development of autonomously driving vehicles, it is now possible to achieve fundamental changes in the design of public transport services especially in terms of cost structures and attractiveness. However, this does not mean that the current structures of line-based service should be eliminated and completely replaced by new, quasi-individual forms of services. Rather, the objective is to extend the existing structures in order to significantly improve mobility provision through more flexibility and thus more attractiveness. The technical basics required for this exist or are already very advanced in the developments. In addition to the necessary vehicles, it is in particular the information and communication systems required for extensive interconnected network structures. However, to make the transformation successful, new organizational concepts and in particular a fundamental rethinking are required. It is not only the technical design of transport, but also to ensure the mobility needs of the population. The related developments and future tasks are outlined and discussed below.;2020;31.07.25 16:12;31.07.25 16:12;;82-99;;;;;;;;;;;Springer International Publishing;Cham;en;;;;;Springer Link;;;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/UHIV75B2/Daduna - 2020 - Evolution of Public Transport in Rural Areas - New Technologies and Digitization.pdf;;;"Autonomous vehicles; Public transport in rural areas; Quasi-individual mobility";"Marcus, Aaron; Rosenzweig, Elizabeth";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The sharp decrease in travel demand and modal share towards the private car versus the unchanged scope of the network creates a dilemma situation, which was reflected by referring cases of advisory projects. The organization of this paper follows the course of investigation: First, a literature review summarizes the state of discussion of alternative service concepts and financing, including subject-oriented subsidization schemes. In the next step, drivers of operating costs and revenues were formalized in a system of geographic zones in the context of a regional transport supply–demand model—complemented by bus operating costs as well as revenues vs. subsidies in the counties under investigation. The obtained as-is ranges of indicators relevant to the bus operators demonstrate the necessity to offset shrinking patronages in conjunction with adequate cost reductions. The case study results were used to substantiate predictions for the upcoming years under an operating environment scenario of 2025. Based on these findings, market research needs and policy recommendations, operationalized by five proposed implementation projects, were derived.;01.10.16;31.07.25 16:47;31.07.25 16:47;31.07.25 16:47;24;;2;2;;Transp. in Dev.

With a fleet of smaller vehicles, DRT provides a much more flexible and convenient service. This characteristic makes DRT also a potential mode of transport to serve students in rural areas. If DRT vehicles are used to serve students, then the funding for conventional school buses (or adapted public transport schedules) can be reinvested in the DRT system. This may help to relieve the financial burden experienced by DRT operators and enable the operation of a large-scale DRT service in rural areas. In this study, a demand model for school commutes based on real-world, open-source data for Landkreis Vulkaneifel, a rural region in Germany, is built. Then a feasibility study is carried out using an agent-based transport simulation framework. In the feasibility study, various setups and operational schemes are explored, which are followed by a systematic cost analysis. Based on a conservative estimation, an annual budget of around 1600 Euro per student will be needed to maintain and operate a fleet of DRT vehicles that can transport all the students in the region from home to school on time in the morning. During the remaining time of the day and on school holidays, the vehicles can be used for conventional DRT service for the public.;2023-12;05.08.25 07:55;05.08.25 07:55;05.08.25 07:55;103837;;;178;;;Demand-responsive transport for students in rural areas;;;;;;;en;https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/;;;;Crossref;;Publisher: Elsevier BV;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/66U2CZ34/Lu et al. - 2023 - Demand-responsive transport for students in rural areas A case study in Vulkaneifel, Germany.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

More recently, the concept of DRT as a niche market has been broadened to include a wider range of ﬂexible, demand-responsive transport services and is increasingly referred to as Flexible Transport Services (FTSs). The contention of this paper is that well-implemented FTS has the potential to revitalise bus-based public transport services which are traditionally based on ﬁxed networks with variable geographical coverage and levels of service.;2009-01;05.08.25 08:08;05.08.25 08:08;05.08.25 08:08;39-45;;1;25;;;Flexible transport services;;;;;;;en;https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/;;;;Crossref;;Publisher: Elsevier BV;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/LSS2DNJX/Mulley und Nelson - 2009 - Flexible transport services A new market opportunity for public transport.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These services usually operate on a stand-alone basis, are often subsidized and are typically only accessible by certain passenger types or for specific trip purposes. This generally results in uncoordinated and inefficient transport provision overall. The Flexible integrated transport services (FITS) system featured in this paper has been designed to address this problem. FITS can be used as a planning tool to assess potential benefits from relaxing operating constraints (e.g., a service's operating boundaries), which can potentially suggest service redesign. It also includes the capacity to assign subsidy payments on a trip by trip basis to increase cost efficiency whilst meeting a greater proportion of transport needs. The case study in the paper focusses on transport to health in the Aberdeenshire and Morayshire areas of Scotland in the UK. Despite flexible transport operators receiving public funds to meet passenger needs, this is currently being supplemented by public bodies paying large amounts in taxi fares in instances where there is a statutory obligation to provide travel but where no other suitable transport service exists. The results demonstrate the potential substantial savings which could be realized by allowing transport operators to redesign their services by relaxing constraints and by the reassignment of subsidies: resulting in more passenger demands being met and a reduction in public spending on taxi fares.;04.03.18;05.08.25 08:27;05.08.25 08:27;05.08.25 08:27;175-185;;2;22;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Taylor and Francis+NEJM;;Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/15472450.2017.1410062;;/Users/alexanderklaus/Zotero/storage/U49HBL54/Mounce et al. - 2018 - A tool to aid redesign of flexible transport services to increase efficiency in rural transport serv.pdf;;;"constraint relaxation; flexible transport system; rural transport; subsidy; surcharge";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
