	abstract = {When demand for transportation is low or highly variable, traditional public bus services tend to lose their efficiency and typically frustrate (potential) passengers. In the literature, a large number of demand-responsive systems, that promise improved flexibility, have therefore been developed. At present, however, a comprehensive survey of these systems is lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a unifying framework that classifies all demand-responsive public bus systems. The classification is mainly based on three degrees of responsiveness: dynamic online, dynamic offline, and static. For each system we discuss the specific optimization problem modeled, whether realistic data is considered, and the size of the instances used for testing. Where possible, we try to draw conclusions on the current state of the literature and try to identify potential avenues for future research. Different tables are included to structure and summarize the information of all papers.},

	abstract = {On-demand multi-passenger shared transport options are increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to reduce traffic congestion and emissions and improve the convenience and travel experience for passengers. These services, often referred to as on-demand public transport, are aimed at meeting personal travel demands through the use of shared vehicles that run on flexible routes using advanced tools for dynamic scheduling. This paper presents an agent-based traffic simulation model that was developed to evaluate the performance of on-demand public transport and compare it with existing scheduled bus services using a case study of the inner city of Melbourne in Australia. The key performance measures used in the comparative evaluation included quality of service and passenger experience in terms of waiting times, the efficiency of service and operations in terms of hourly vehicle utilization, and system efficiency in terms of trip completion rates, passenger kilometers travelled and total passenger trip times. The results showed significant benefits for passengers who use on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services. The on-demand bus service was found to reduce average total passenger waiting times by 89\% during the Morning Peak; by 78\% during the Mid-Day period; by 81\% during the Afternoon Peak; and by more than 95\% during other periods of the day. From an operator’s perspective, the on-demand services were found to achieve around 70\% vehicle utilization rates during peak hours compared to a utilization rate not exceeding 16\% for the scheduled bus services. Even during off-peak periods, the occupancies for on-demand services were almost twice the vehicle occupancies for scheduled bus services. In terms of system efficiency, the on-demand services achieved a trip completion rate of 85\% compared to a trip completion rate of 67\% for the scheduled bus services. The total passenger-kilometers travelled was similar for both scheduled and on-demand bus services, which refutes claims that on-demand bus services induce more kilometers of travel. The trip completion times were around 55\% shorter for on-demand bus services compared to scheduled services, which represents a significant saving in travel time for users. Finally, the paper presents average emissions per completed trip for both types of services and shows a significant reduction in emissions for on-demand services compared to conventional bus services. These include, on average, a 48\% reduction in {CO}2 emissions per trip; 82\% reduction in {NO} emissions per trip; and 41\% reduction in p.m.10 emissions per trip. These findings clearly demonstrate the superior benefits of on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services.},

	abstract = {On-Demand Bus is a Demand Responsive Transit ({DRT}) service that passengers will be transported by the vehicles after they reserve a seat. The vehicle wonpsilat move if there is no reservation and the efficiency is expected as a new transportation service. It allows potential passengers to request service via the Internet or mobile phone, with requests for ride being processed by a server computer. The requests compose of pick-up location, delivery location and desired delivery time (or pick-up time). The computer executes two main algorithms which are vehicle-choosing algorithm and routing algorithm. Using the vehicle-choosing algorithm was used for decision about which vehicle will accept the new request. And the routing algorithm was used to design the new route and schedule for the vehicle chosen to serve the new request. After calculation, the system will report to the customer whether the request is accepted or not. If it is accepted, the vehicle will pick up and deliver him to his destination within a guaranteed time - not later than the desired delivery time (or not earlier than pick-up time). We also carried out an experiment to evaluate the developed algorithm worked as we designed.},

On-demand transport is an emerging mode of urban passenger transport that relies on meeting passenger demand for travel using dynamic and flexible scheduling using shared vehicles. Initially, a simulation model was developed to replicate existing fixed-schedule bus performance and was then extended to incorporate on-demand transport services within the same network. The simulation results were used to undertake a comparative analysis which included reliability, service quality, operational efficiency, network-wide effectiveness, and environmental impacts. The results showed that on-demand buses reduced average passenger trip time by 30\%, increased vehicle occupancy rates from 8\% to over 50\%, and reduced emissions per passenger by over 70\% on an average weekday compared to fixed-schedule buses. This study also offers insights for successful on-demand transport implementation, promoting urban sustainability. It also outlines future research directions, particularly the need for accurate short-term passenger demand prediction to improve service provision and passenger experience.},

	abstract = {The real-time on-demand bus routing problem ({ODBRP}) supports the online routing of buses in a large-scale ride-sharing system. Given are a set of buses with fixed capacity, a set of bus stations and a set of transportation requests, only part of which are known before the planning horizon. A request consists of a set of possible departure and arrival stations, as well as an earliest departure and latest arrival time. The aim is to (1) assign each passenger to a departure and arrival bus station and (2) develop a set of bus routes to fulfill each request within its time window while minimizing the sum of the total waiting time and the total user ride time. Including the possibility for requests to be issued after the start of the planning horizon, i.e., when buses have already started servicing other requests, requires a dynamic re-optimization of a partially executed solution. Compared to the case in which all requests are known beforehand, the solution quality, expressed as the total waiting and user ride time, is expected to decline. This decline in objective function value can be seen as the “cost” of the dynamic requests. In this paper, we introduce the real-time {ODBRP} as an extension of its static problem variant and present a heuristic to deal with dynamic requests. In addition, an extensive set of experiments allows us to conclude that dynamic requests indeed lead to higher waiting and user ride times, especially for passengers who submit their request at the last minute. Passengers are therefore encouraged, if possible, to send their request well in advance, as this results in lower and more stable service promises, higher customer satisfaction, and higher revenues for the operating on-demand bus company.},

We present the static version of the {ODBRP}, as well as a straightforward large neighborhood search heuristic to solve it. The performance of the heuristic is established by comparing it to an off-the-shelve heuristic solver ({LocalSolver}). We also use our heuristic to solve (slightly modified instances of) the well-known dial-a-ride problem. The results found by the heuristic for the on-demand bus system are compared to those of a simulated traditional public bus system with fixed lines and timetables. A thorough analysis of the comparison demonstrates that total user ride times can be significantly lower in an on-demand public bus system and shows that an on-demand bus system works best with a large number of small buses.},

However, the existing studies in this area almost focus on human-driven vehicles which face some striking limitations (e.g., restricted crew scheduling and fixed vehicle capacity) and can weaken the overall benefits. This paper proposes a two-phase optimization procedure to fully unleash the potential of {MAEVs} by leveraging the strengths of {MAEVs}, including automatic allocation and charging of modules. In the first phase, a mixed integer programming model is established in the space-time-state framework to jointly optimize the {MAEV} routing and charging, passenger-to-vehicle assignment and vehicle capacity management for reserved passengers. A Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. In the second phase, three dispatching strategies are designed and optimized by a dynamic dispatching procedure to properly adapt the operation of {MAEVs} to emerging travel demands. A case study conducted on a major urban area of Beijing, China, demonstrates the high efficiency of the {MAEV} adoption in terms of resource utilization and environmental friendliness across a range of travel demand distributions, vehicle supply and module capacity scenarios.},

	abstract = {On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence ({AI}), Internet of Things ({IoT}), and Cloud and Fog computing—is helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand ({FMoD}) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual ‘use cases’ that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of {FMoD} and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.},

In this problem, the platform plans customized bus routes upon receiving a batch of orders released by passengers and informs the passengers of the planned pick-up and drop-off locations. The related decision process takes into account some passenger-side time window-related requirements, walking limits, the availability and capacities of various types of buses. A mixed-integer linear programming model of this new {VRP} variant with floating targets (passengers) is formulated. To solve the model efficiently, a solution method is developed that combines the branch-and-bound and column generation algorithms and also includes embedded acceleration techniques such as the multi-labeling algorithm. Experiments based on real data from Dalian, China are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and efficiency of the algorithm; the small-scale experimental results demonstrate our algorithm can obtain optimal results in the majority of instances. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted, and model extensions are investigated, to provide customized bus service platform operators with potentially useful managerial insights; for example, a platform need not establish as many candidate stops as possible, a wide range of walking distance may not bring early arrival at destinations for customers, more mini-buses should be deployed than large buses in our real-world case. Moreover, the rolling horizon-based context and zoning strategies are also investigated by extending our proposed methodology.},

A compact set of estimations of the user performance and operating cost is provided, based on geometric probability. The optimization procedure allows the cost comparison of different semi-flexible services. Transit systems operated by cars (shared taxicabs) with flexible layouts are preferable for low demand densities (less than 92 pax/km2-h). For very high demand (higher than 200 pax/km2-h), bus systems with fixed layout and variable stop locations present the lowest total cost per passenger. In an intermediate domain, taxi and semi-flexible services compete among each other. The estimation of unit operating costs allows decision-makers to calculate the subsidies needed to make the system profitable.},

Requests have a set of possible departure/arrival bus stations within walking distance of the actual departure/arrival location and have to be served within a certain time window. The aim is to simultaneously (1) decide on the trip type for each passenger (only bus, only metro or mixed), (2) route the on-demand buses, (3) in the case of a bus-leg in the trip, assign each passenger to a departure and arrival bus station (bus station assignment), and (4) in the case of a metro-leg in the trip, decide the assigned transfer station(s) and used metro lines (transfer station assignment). We call this problem the integrated on-demand bus routing problem. After presenting a mathematical model, we propose a quick and scalable insertion-based heuristic to solve the problem. The results found by the heuristic are further used to compare the performance of an integrated system, to a system that only uses on-demand buses. It is concluded that the integrated system always performs better regarding the service rate or number of served requests.

	abstract = {App-based services and ridesharing in the field of mobility-on-demand ({MoD}) create a new mode of transport between motorized individual transport and public transportation whose long-term role in the urban mobility landscape and within public transport systems is not fully understood as of today. For the public transport industry, these new services offer new chances but also risks, making planning models and tools for integrated intermodal network planning indispensable. We develop a strategic network planning optimization model for bus lines that allows for intermodal trips with {MoD} as a first or last leg. Starting from an existing public transport network, we decide simultaneously on the use of existing line segments in the future fixed-route network, on areas of the city where an integrated {MoD} service should be offered, on how {MoD} interacts with the fixed-route network via transfer points, and on passenger routes fulfilling given service-level requirements. The main challenges from a modeling point of view are to capture the interplay between {MoD} services and the fixed public network, as well as the approximation of {MoD} costs taking into account that vehicle utilization is a key factor influencing these costs. We develop a path-based formulation and a branch-and-price algorithm, as well as an enhanced enumeration-based approach, to solve real-world instances to proven optimality. The solution methods are tested on instances generated with the help of real-world data from a medium-sized German city, Göttingen, that currently operates around 20 bus lines.},

	abstract = {We propose to solve a real-time traffic variation of the On-Demand Bus Routing Problem ({ODBRP}) introduced by Melis and Sörensen (2022). The {ODBRP} belongs to the category of the Dial-A-Ride Problems ({DARP}), and features departure and arrival bus station selection. This problem is specifically aimed at planning a fleet of on-demand buses in an urban environment. However, cities are frequently plagued by traffic congestion, which may cause delays and missed time windows for passengers. To deal with this situation, we introduce, study, and solve a variant of the {ODBRP} in which the travel times are both time-dependent (i.e., the travel time between two nodes depends on the departure time) and updated dynamically. In our approach, congested roads that might cause passenger delays are modeled by frequently updating the travel speed on the road segments that constitute them. The resulting problem is solved by using a K-shortest-path procedure to determine alternative paths between bus stations, as well as a Variable Neighborhood Descent ({VND}) procedure to repair violated time windows. Our experimental results show the overall efficacy of this real-time control under divergent degrees of flexibility (congestion and the number of buses available). Specifically, the average tardiness, maximum tardiness, and the number of late passengers are significantly reduced under a wide range of congestion scenarios, from slight to severe. In addition, this efficacy holds for various ratios of requests to the number of vehicles.},

We propose a framework based on a random multilayer bus network, from which we develop four topological metrics to quantify network robustness. Additionally, we conduct network attack simulations to derive simulation-based robustness indicators, which are acknowledged as golden rules in robustness measurements. Correlation analysis between the proposed metrics reveals a positive relationship between the topological properties and network robustness, validating the effectiveness of the topological metrics in assessing the robustness of networks with uncertain topology. This study fills a gap in the existing literature by providing a robustness analysis framework specifically tailored to on-demand bus networks, contributing to the design of more resilient on-demand bus systems.},

	abstract = {On-demand ridepooling ({ODRP}) vehicles follow routes that are fully flexible. However, when the system does not provide door-to-door service and users can be asked to walk, their paths tend to concentrate, particularly along main streets that connect highly demanded areas of the city. These frequently travelled segments are hence useful to multiple passengers, which can be used as an indicator that it would be efficient to allocate a fixed public transport line there. In this paper, we formalise this idea and propose a novel method to design a public transport network, where bus fixed lines are combined with {ODRP}. Given a network and a transport demand, we first simulate how to serve it using only {ODRP} with walking. For this, we employ a state-of-the-art assignment algorithm, and take as output the resulting users’ paths. These paths are then processed by a tailored algorithm to create fixed lines where the paths accumulate the most. Users who do not have an available fixed line (i.e., those whose paths were barely shared) are served by {ODRP} in the mixed system. Simulations using real-life data from Utrecht, The Netherlands, and the Sunshine Coast, Australia, reveal the merits of our method compared to several benchmarks. Crucially, our method builds a small number of fixed lines while still serving the majority of the demand through them. This study contributes not only to the design of public transport networks, but also to the understanding of the patterns that naturally appear in intrinsically flexible mobility systems.},

In general, minimizing the resultant charging costs such as charging duration or charging amount is also part of the objective of the {EVRP}. Accordingly, the {EVRP} has received considerable attention over the past years. Nevertheless, this type of problem in the domain of passenger transportation, a {VRP} variant, has been rarely studied in the literature, especially with time windows, a realistic nonlinear charging function or a partial charging policy. Hence this research extends the existing work on the {EVRP} to the on-demand bus routing problem ({ODBRP}) which transports passengers with the bus station assignment ({BSA}). The resultant problem is the electric {ODBRP} ({EODBRP}). Specifically, each passenger can have more than one stations to board or alight, and they are assigned to the ones with the smallest increase in the total user ride time ({URT}). In the {EODBRP}, frequent intermediate visits to {CSs} are considered. Moreover, a nonlinear charging function is used and the partial charging strategy is applied. To solve the {EODBRP}, a greedy insertion method with a ‘charging first, routing second’ strategy is developed, followed by a large neighborhood search ({LNS}) which consists of local search ({LS}) operators to further improve the solution quality. Experimental data are generated by a realistic instance generator based on a real city map, and the corresponding results show that the proposed heuristic algorithm performs well in solving the {EODBRP}. Finally, sensitivity analyses with divergent parameters such as the temporal distributions of passengers and bus ranges may provide practical guidance.},

To use the on-demand service, users communicate, close to their desired departure time, the origin and destination of the trip. They accept the service if the estimated arrival time at destination fulfills their service level threshold. In the simulation users may decide whether to walk, to use a standard bus, to call the on-demand service, and, if none of these options is satisfactory, to use a private car. We consider different scenarios to assess the potential benefits of the introduction of an on-demand service. We also analyze the scalability and responsiveness of the service. The results suggest that an on-demand system may be able to satisfy a large portion of user transportation requests and may be put beside standard transportation systems in order to provide a better transportation service to the users and substantially reduce the use of private cars.},

A numerical analysis based on Meishan Island data in Ningbo indicates that with on-demand bus services, the total generalized cost incurred by buses and travelers can be reduced by 30.36\% and 15.35\% during rush and off-rush hours, respectively. Additionally, the waiting time at an on-demand bus stop is only 4.3 min during rush hours and 6.8 min during off-rush hours.},

In order to find a more effective travel plan to the problem, we adopt Q-learning which is one of the machine learning algorithms. However, native Q-learning is inadequate to our target problem because the number of customers at pick-up points is time-dependent. Therefore, we improve an update process of Q values and a selection process of the next pick-up point, on the basis of time passage parameters. In particular, rewards are understated in update process, on the other hand, Q values are overstated in selection process. At the last, we report our simulation results and show the effectiveness of our algorithm for the problem.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first application of prepositioning in the context of the dynamic stochastic on-demand bus routing problem ({DODBRP}). The {DODBRP} is a large-scale dial-a-ride problem that involves bus station assignment and aims to minimize the total user ride time ({URT}) by simultaneously assigning passengers to alternative stations and determining optimal bus routes. In the {DODBRP}, transportation requests are introduced dynamically, and buses are dispatched to stations with known requests. This paper investigates the concept of prepositioning, which involves sending buses not only to currently known requests but also to requests that are likely to appear in the future, based on a given probability. To solve this dynamic and stochastic {ODBRP}, the paper proposes a heuristic algorithm based on variable neighborhood search ({VNS}). The algorithm considers multiple scenarios to represent different realizations of the stochastic requests. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the prepositioning approach over the {DODBRP} across various levels of forecast accuracy, lengths of time bucket, and probabilities of realization. Furthermore, the paper shows that removing empty stations as a recourse action can further enhance solution quality. Additionally, in situations with low prediction accuracy, increasing the number of scenarios can lead to improved solutions. Finally, a combination of prepositioning, empty station removal, and the insertion of dynamic requests proves to be effective. Overall, the findings of this paper provide valuable insights into the application of prepositioning in the dynamic stochastic on-demand bus routing problem, highlighting its potential for addressing real-world transportation challenges.},

To increase the efficiency of service during peak hours, in this paper, we propose an on-demand operation that allows vehicles to take some shortcuts between the city center and the terminal, based on the passenger requests that are collected before the peak hours. We develop a variable neighborhood search ({VNS}) algorithm to optimize the operational decisions of this system. Based on the received requests, the {VNS} algorithm decides the following: (1) shortcut decisions: which shortcuts to take by each bus in each direction, (2) departure time decisions: when to depart from the city center and the terminal, and (3) passenger assignment decisions: which service serves each passenger. Experiments show that the total passenger travel time improves up to 45\% on a real-size line compared to its traditional fixed-route operation. The performance of the system is also analyzed under different circumstances.},
