      \field{abstract}{Flexible-route bus systems serving passengers at their doorsteps may be preferable to ﬁxed-route bus systems in areas with low demand densities or whose roads cannot accommodate relatively large ﬁxed-route buses. Flexible-route systems may also be preferable for elderly or handicapped riders for whom accessing the pre-determined stops on ﬁxed routes is diﬃcult. Since bus systems with ﬂexible demand-responsive routes retain the economic and environmental advantages of public transportation, it is important to analyze them and optimize their characteristics to match their operating environments. This study shows how the total cost can be minimized for a ﬂexible-route bus system with a many-to-one demand pattern by jointly optimizing its headway and service zone size. Numerical results demonstrate the model’s applicability and indicate how such ﬂexible-route systems should be adapted to demand characteristics and planning constraints.}

      \field{abstract}{The introduction of autonomous buses and taxis is expected to generate such benefits as cost reductions—and particularly for regional bus operations with a substantial deficit—as well as enhancing public transit accessibility through decreased trip costs. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the impacts of introducing autonomous buses and taxis on metropolitan transportation systems by quantifying the costs of travel in Japan, and to discuss the potential benefits. First, this study sets the assumptions on autonomous driving technology, including its impacts on vehicle costs, the decreased labor costs for driving and safety monitoring in buses and taxis, and decreased driving stress for private car users. Next, operating costs are computed for autonomous buses and taxis in Japanese metropolitan areas. The costs of travel, or the sum of monetary and time costs, are then computed with and without vehicle automation for different trip types in high- and low-density metropolitan areas. The results highlight that the costs of public transit trips that currently have a smaller share of time costs in overall trip costs could decrease considerably due to vehicle automation. For instance, costs for 10–20-km trip lengths could decrease by 44–61\% for taxi trips and 13–37\% for rail/bus trips with taxi access, followed by a decrease of 6–11\% for bus trips and 1–11\% for rail trips with bus access. Further, private car trip costs could decrease by 11–16\%. More substantial cost reductions in rail/bus trips with taxi access could occur in the case of smaller trip distances and/or in residential areas far from stations; larger reductions in rail trips with bus access could occur in low-density metropolitan areas. Finally, it is expected that vehicle automation in more fixed modes of public road transit could primarily benefit the transit industry and government, with such effects as improved labor productivity and reduced subsidies, while vehicle automation in more flexible modes could benefit metropolitan residents as well as the transit industry. This further suggests that a deficit of regional bus operations could be recovered during the transition to the full performance of autonomous buses.}

      \field{abstract}{Smartphone technology enables dynamic ride-sharing systems that bring together people with similar itineraries and time schedules to share rides on short-notice. This paper considers the problem of matching drivers and riders in this dynamic setting. We develop optimization-based approaches that aim at minimizing the total system-wide vehicle miles incurred by system users, and their individual travel costs. To assess the merits of our methods we present a simulation study based on 2008 travel demand data from metropolitan Atlanta. The simulation results indicate that the use of sophisticated optimization methods instead of simple greedy matching rules substantially improve the performance of ride-sharing systems. Furthermore, even with relatively low participation rates, it appears that sustainable populations of dynamic ride-sharing participants may be possible even in relatively sprawling urban areas with many employment centers.}

      \field{abstract}{Simulation studies suggest that pooled on-demand services (also referred to as Demand Responsive Transport, ridesharing, shared ride-hailing or shared ridesourcing services) have the potential to bring large benefits to urban areas while inducing limited time losses for their users. However, in reality, the large majority of users request individual rides (and not pooled rides) in existing on-demand services, leading to increases in motorised vehicle miles travelled. In this study, we investigate to what extent fare discounts, additional travel time, and the (un)willingness to share the ride with (different numbers of) other passengers play a role in the decision of individuals to share rides. To this end, we design a stated preference study targeting Dutch urban individuals. In our research, we (1) disentangle the sharing aspect from related time–cost trade-offs (e.g. detours), (2) investigate preference heterogeneity regarding the studied attributes and identify distinct market segments, and (3) simulate scenarios to understand the impact of the obtained parameters in the breakdown between individual and pooled services. We find that less than one third of respondents have strong preferences against sharing their rides. Also, we find that different market segments vary not only in their values of the willingness to share, but also in how they perceive this willingness to share (per-ride or proportional to the in-vehicle time). Further, the scenario analysis demonstrates that the share of individuals who are willing to share rides depends primarily on the time–cost trade-offs, rather than on the disutility stemming from pooling rides per se.}

      \field{abstract}{Demand-responsive transport ({DRT}) services (collective on-demand services, such as shared ridesourcing and microtransit) offer a collective flexible travel alternative that can potentially complement fixed transit ({FT}). The combination of an on-demand and line-based service holds the promise of improved mobility and increased service coverage. However, to date, it remains unknown whether {DRT} services deliver these much anticipated improvements. This study presents an assessment framework to evaluate the performance of {DRT} and related changes in accessibility, and performs an empirical analysis for a recently introduced {DRT} service in the Netherlands. The framework includes a performance benchmark between {DRT} and {FT} based on the computation of generalized journey times of the {DRT} rides and the {FT} alternatives, and can help identify whether {DRT} is used as a complement or a substitute for {FT}. The framework covers the spatial and temporal dimensions, and the explicit consideration of rejected trips is an integral part of the evaluation. Results suggest large accessibility improvements for {DRT} users, especially for some underserved origin–destination pairs.}

      \field{abstract}{The uptake of on-demand services is increasing rapidly all over the world. However, the market share of their pooled version (ridesharing, e.g., {UberPOOL} or {LyftLine}) is still low, despite its potential in addressing the mobility challenges that dense urban cities are facing. In this research, we analyse user preferences towards pooled on-demand services regarding their time-reliabilitycost trade-offs. We study, via stated preference experiments, the value of time ({VOT}) and value of reliability ({VOR}) of the different trip stages (waiting stage, in-vehicle stage, and transfer stage when combined with line-based public transport). We target urban Dutch individuals (N = 1006), and address commuting and leisure trips. Results show in-vehicle {VOT} for pooled on-demand services to amount to 7.88–10.80 €/h. These values are somewhat higher than known values of traditional public transport. We also find waiting {VOT} (both before the trip and during the transfer stage) to be lower than values previously reported in literature. In general, we find {VOR} to be lower than {VOT}: the reliability ratio ({VOR}/{VOT} ratio) for both the waiting stage and the in-vehicle stage being around 0.5. In order to understand different preferences, we also estimate latent class choice models. The analysis shows that the main difference between classes pertains to the overall time-cost and reliability-cost trade-offs ({VOT} and {VOR} values) rather than in different valuations of the reliability ratio. In addition to serving as input for demand forecasting models such as macroscopic static assignment and agent-based simulation models, our findings can support service providers in developing their strategy when designing pooled ondemand services.}

      \field{abstract}{Significance Ride-sharing services can provide not only a very personalized mobility experience but also ensure efficiency and sustainability via large-scale ride pooling. Large-scale ride-sharing requires mathematical models and algorithms that can match large groups of riders to a fleet of shared vehicles in real time, a task not fully addressed by current solutions. We present a highly scalable anytime optimal algorithm and experimentally validate its performance using New York City taxi data and a shared vehicle fleet with passenger capacities of up to ten. Our results show that 2,000 vehicles (15\% of the taxi fleet) of capacity 10 or 3,000 of capacity 4 can serve 98\% of the demand within a mean waiting time of 2.8 min and mean trip delay of 3.5 min. , Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that ( i ) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and ( ii ) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with ∼3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.}

      \field{abstract}{This case-study aims at a comparison of the service quality of time-tabled buses as compared to on-demand ridepooling cabs in the late evening hours in the city of Wuppertal, Germany. To evaluate the service quality of ridepooling as compared to bus services, and to simulate bus rides during the evening hours, transport requests are generated using a predictive simulation. To this end, a framework in the programming language R is created, which automatically combines generalized linear models for count regression to model the demand at each bus stop. Furthermore, we use classification models for the prediction of trip destinations. To solve the resulting dynamic dial-a-ride problem, a rolling-horizon algorithm based on the iterative solution of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Models ({MILP}) is used. A feasible-path heuristic is used to enhance the performance of the algorithm in presence of high request densities. This allows an estimation of the number of cabs needed depending on the weekday to realize the same or a better general service quality as the bus system.}

      \field{abstract}{Among the new transportation services made possible by the introduction of automated vehicles, automated mobility-on-demand ({AMoD}) has attracted a lot of attention from both industry and researchers. {AMoD} provides a service similar to taxi or ride-sharing services, while being driverless. It is expected to attract a huge fraction of travelers currently using mass transit or private vehicles and will have a disruptive effect on urban transportation. While most studies have focused on the operational efficiency of the technology itself, our work aims to investigate its impact on urban mobility. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we present a flexible {AMoD} modeling and simulation framework developed within a multi-modal agent-based urban simulation platform ({SimMobility}). The framework allows the detailed simulation and assessment of different {AMoD} operations together with an activity-based framework that accounts for changes in demand, such as activity participation, trip making, mode, destination, or route choice decisions. Second, we focus our attention on the role of mass transit in a futuristic urban system where {AMoD} is widely available. Mass transit is already challenged by current ride-sharing services, for example, Uber and Lyft, which provide comparatively better and cheaper services. This trend will plausibly be exacerbated with the introduction of {AMoD}, which may indirectly act as a replacement to mass transit. Our simulation results show that mass transit is irreplaceable, despite the high efficiency of {AMoD}, in order to avoid congestion and maintain a sustainable urban transportation system with acceptable levels of service.}

      \field{abstract}{Transport can play a key role in mitigating climate change, through reducing traffic, emissions and dependency on private vehicles. Transport is also crucial to connect remote areas to central or urban areas. Yet, sustainable and flexible transport is among the greatest challenges for rural areas and rural–urban regions. Innovative transport concepts and approaches are urgently needed to foster sustainable and integrated regional development. This article addresses challenges of sustainability, accessibility, and connectivity through examining complementary systems to existing public transport, including demand-responsive transport and multimodal mobility. We draw upon case studies from the Metropolitan Area of Styria, Ljubljana Urban Region and rural Wales ({GUSTmobil}, {REGIOtim}, {EURBAN}, Bicikelj, Bwcabus, Grass Routes). In-depth analysis through a mixed-methods case study design captures the complexity behind these chosen examples, which form a basis for analysing the effects of services on accessibility for different groups, connectivity to public transport and usability as a “first and last mile” feeder. We further explore the weaknesses of complementary transport systems, including legal, organisational and financial barriers, and offer potential solutions to structure and communicate complementary transport systems to improve access and use. Looking ahead, we use the case studies to anticipate innovative, sustainable “mobility as a service” ({MaaS}) solutions within and between urban and rural areas and consider how future public policy orientations and arrangements can enable positive change. A main concern of our article and the contribution to scientific literature is through exploring the benefit of well-established multi-level governance arrangements when introducing smaller-scale mobility solutions to improve rural–urban accessibility. It becomes clear that not a one-size-fits-all model but placed-based and tailored approaches lead to successful and sustainable concepts.}

      \field{abstract}{Recently, ridesharing services have grown rapidly. In future, fleets of shared and pooled autonomous vehicles may transform urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce an approach to dynamically simulate these services within a full-stack transport simulation using an insertion-based algorithm. In a first test case, using a taxi data set from Berlin, the potential for shared rides is evaluated using a fleet of vehicles with a capacity between two and four ride requests. The simulation suggests that the overall vehicle kilometers traveled may be reduced by 15–20\%, while travel time increases can be kept at a relatively low level of less than three minutes per person. Additionally, the simulation results suggest in which areas of the city it may be the most rewarding to offer shared services.}

      \field{abstract}{Over the past decades, the Vehicle Routing Problem ({VRP}) and its variants have grown ever more popular in the academic literature. Yet, the problem characteristics and assumptions vary widely and few literature reviews have made an effort to classify the existing articles accordingly. In this article, we present a taxonomic review of the {VRP} literature published between 2009 and June 2015. Based on an adapted version of an existing comprehensive taxonomy, we classify 277 articles and analyze the trends in the {VRP} literature. This classiﬁcation is the ﬁrst to categorize the articles to this level of detail.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper focuses on recent British experience with telematics-based Demand Responsive Transport ({DRT}) services in rural areas. In recent years, the ability of {DRT} concepts to provide eﬃcient, viable transport services has been greatly enhanced by the use of transport telematics as demonstrated in a variety of environments across Europe. The success of British local authorities in winning substantial funding under the Rural and Urban Bus Challenge programmes for the implementation of {DRT} has resulted in widespread interest in ﬂexible forms of transport. It is thus timely to evaluate the impact of this substantial investment. Drawing on the experience of a number of {UK} schemes, the paper assesses the reasons for the new-found success of what is becoming a relatively well-accepted mode by concentrating on a variety of factors including: service characteristics (particularly route ﬂexibility, ﬂexibility of booking method and pre-booking regime), emerging markets and the overall contribution of {DRT} to increased social inclusion and intermodality. Impediments to the development of {DRT} services are highlighted. The paper also discusses current research into the next generation of {DRT} services and concludes by identifying some key issues for policy-makers concerned with the future implementation of {DRT} services.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper presents an agent-based model ({ABM}) to simulate and compare two different operation strategies of a public transport service in small-sized cities, namely a fixed-route transit ({FRT}) and a demand-responsive transport ({DRT}) service, under varying demand rates and supply configurations. The {ABM} builds upon a previous work by the Authors, where flexible and feeder services of a Mass Rapid Transit system were simulated. In this paper, instead of a many-to-one pattern typical of a feeder service, we considered a many-to-many one. The objective is to investigate the conditions that make a {DRT} more attractive than a {FRT} in small-sized cities and guide its design considering the demand fluctuation, land-use pattern, service constraints and passenger preferences. A dispatching algorithm for the {DRT} allows to assign each new trip request to a vehicle, and a couple of origin and destination stops, updating the vehicle schedule in real time. The service includes fixed and virtual stops, allowing request consolidation and balancing operator-related (cost of the service) and user-related (quality of service) needs. The model is applied to Vittoria (Italy), a small city with 60,000 residents in Southern Italy where most trips are made by car, also due to the absence of an urban public transport service. First results highlight the benefits of providing a flexible service compared to a fixed one to minimize detours, waiting times and walking distances experienced by passengers while allowing for a higher shareability and efficiency of the service.}

      \field{abstract}{The first/last mile problem in urban transportation services refers to limited connectivity and accessibility to high capacity commuter lines. This is often encountered in low-density residential areas, where low flexibility and resources of traditional public transportation systems lead to reduced service coverage. Demand-responsive transit ({DRT}) offers an alternative for providing first/last mile feeder services to low density areas, because of its flexibility in adjusting to different demand patterns. This paper presents a mathematical model and a genetic algorithm for efficiently designing {DRT} type first/last mile routes. The model is applied for the case of a residential area in Athens, Greece and results are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{On-demand ridesplitting is a form of ridesourcing where riders with similar origins and destinations are matched to the same driver and vehicle in real time, and the ride and costs are split among users. With the convenience of all kinds of ridesourcing services, the number of ridesplitting passengers increases, which may have a great impact on the urban mobility. In this paper, we analyze ridesplitting behavior and its impact on multimodal mobility, e.g., vehicle kilometers traveled ({VKT}) and transportation modal shift, using real-world ridesourcing data extracted from an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China, and questionnaires filled by on-demand ridesplitting passengers. With the consideration of the {VKT} shifted from non-passenger/private vehicles, this paper uses the saved {VKT} of two ridesplitting types, e.g., {DiDi} Hitch and {DiDi} Express ridesplitting, to quantify the ridesplitting impact. For the whole ridesourcing ecosystem, ridesplitting is estimated to decrease 58,124 {VKT} per day in Hangzhou, of which Hitch and Express ridesplitting contribute 2175 km and 55,949 km per day, respectively. The saved {VKT} of Hitch is much smaller than Express ridesplitting for the following two reasons: (1) Hitch orders are fewer than Express ridesplitting; (2) more than half of the Hitch passengers shift modes from bus/metro transit or other non-passenger/private cars. This paper shines some lights on understanding the emerging on-demand ridesplitting behavior and quantifying its impact on multimodal urban mobility.}

      \field{abstract}{Recently published transport innovation, transport service, mobility narratives and transportation alternatives literature focus on mounting needs for older people in reflection of increasing longevity and active and healthier lifestyles over previous generations. The aim of this review is to raise awareness and stress the knowledge gap on the importance of transport innovations for this age group, particularly in regards to needs and innovative requisites (i.e., vehicle, transport infrastructure and organisational makeup). A scoping literature search identified 106 publications as relevant literature from the more than 2500 reviewed publications. Transport need for the elderly is discussed by way of accessibility, affordability, availability and acceptability. Vehicle innovation examines pedestrian data, vehicle design (i.e., private cars and vehicles in public transport), fixed route services, paratransit vehicles and slow mode alternatives such as cycling, motorised mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs. Transport infrastructure innovation takes into account technical infrastructural adjustments, related recommendations and guidelines and specific solutions for peri-urban and rural areas. Organisational innovation investigates governmental support mechanisms, legislation, financial limitations, education and social-based training and internet as well as relating information and communication technology-based findings. Vast majority of the research is centric to developed countries. Identified gaps in the literature and novel areas for future research are examined.}

      \field{abstract}{The diffusion of the smartphone and the urban sprawl is pushing both private and public actors to revisit the concept of demand-responsive transport ({DRT}). This paper provides a historical overview of {DRT} experiences, understanding their pros and cons. In addition, it presents the case study of Mokumflex, a 12-month {DRT} pilot program that replaced the regular bus service in low-density areas of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Based on a close collaboration with the private enterprise that operated the service and also with the local bus operator, we performed an empirical before and after comparison. These insights help to understand the impacts of {DRT} systems and support (future) design of {DRT} and public transport. A set of indicators was chosen for the intermodal comparison: travel distances, ridership, costs, Greenhouse Gases ({GHG}), emissions and population's perception. Ridership dropped from 78.1 passengers/day to 15.9 passengers/day, however, for being “demand-tailored”, passenger-km reduced even more, going from 1252.8 km/day to 136.6 km/day, hence reducing the costs and {GHG} emissions per passenger. In regards to population's perception, the system enjoyed a good evaluation.}

      \field{abstract}{In low density areas, due to limited economic resources, public transport ({PT}) companies usually operate services with low frequency, poor accessibility and reliability and high waiting times at stops. Several studies highlighted that introducing Demand Responsive Transport Services ({DRTs}) can improve {PT} performance in these areas. In Italy, several {DRTs} have been launched, characterized by flexible schedules with different operational configurations: fixed route, with and without detours and flexible route. Considering the importance of sharing lessons from pilots, the paper presents a {DRT} pilot study, conducted in Palermo (Italy) within the {WEAKI} {TRANSIT} project, identifying strategies for planning and designing on-demand shared systems. The pilot was conducted in a suburban area in the north of Palermo, covering about 10.5 km2 with the neighbourhoods of Partanna Mondello and Tommaso Natale. This area is poorly served by {PT} companies with low-frequency and low-reliability bus lines, thus a stop-based {DRT} service with two fixed routes and detours was hypothesized. The pilot was conducted during November and December 2022, with four cars, operating from 3 to 7 p.m., except Sunday. The service, free of charge, was addressed to students and teaching staff by University of Palermo. Through {SP} surveys, simulation model and pilot, we evaluate operational performance of the services (i.e. travel distance, waiting and in-vehicle times). We found the introduction of {DRTs} lead to increasing accessibility to main transit hubs and facilities, and a decrease in waiting times at stops and travel times. Nevertheless, considerations about financial feasibility and legal framework are highlighted.}

      \field{abstract}{Public transport in rural areas is currently often characterized by inadequate services, so that motorized private transport dominates these areas. This situation is considered to be unsatisfactory from an economic and social policy perspective, as it has considerable negative environmental effects. The main problems here are a decline in economic performance and an aging population as well as an increasing rural exodus. With the development of autonomously driving vehicles, it is now possible to achieve fundamental changes in the design of public transport services especially in terms of cost structures and attractiveness. However, this does not mean that the current structures of line-based service should be eliminated and completely replaced by new, quasi-individual forms of services. Rather, the objective is to extend the existing structures in order to significantly improve mobility provision through more flexibility and thus more attractiveness. The technical basics required for this exist or are already very advanced in the developments. In addition to the necessary vehicles, it is in particular the information and communication systems required for extensive interconnected network structures. However, to make the transformation successful, new organizational concepts and in particular a fundamental rethinking are required. It is not only the technical design of transport, but also to ensure the mobility needs of the population. The related developments and future tasks are outlined and discussed below.}

      \field{abstract}{Flexible transport services include a range of passenger transport mobility offers, where services are flexible in one or more of the dimensions of route, vehicle allocation, vehicle operator, type of payment and passenger category. Although flexible transport services are used increasingly in Europe and the {USA} as part of the public transport mix where regular services are not sustainable, there are few working examples of these services in urban Australia, although there are many opportunities. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in New South Wales, Australia, the article identifies barriers to greater use of flexible transport services in low-density urban areas. These five sets of barriers include: institutional frameworks such as regulation; economic issues of funding and cost; operational issues such as fleet and vehicles; operator and community attitudes, awareness and cultures; and information and education. The article makes recommendations to enable and encourage greater use of flexible transport services by transport service planners and providers as part of the public transport mix in low-density urban environments where it can be more difficult to provide regular and scheduled public transport.}

      \field{abstract}{Rural feeder service between villages and bus stops is largely a missing component in developing countries such as India. Traditionally, planning of rural feeder service has been carried out without due consideration to indirect costs associated with hard factors (e.g., walking distance and waiting time) and soft factors (e.g., crowding inside vehicles) of the service. A case study is presented for the planning of rural feeder service with due consideration to direct and indirect costs to users and operational viability of the service. Direct and indirect costs to users are expressed in terms of a comprehensive measure called generalized cost ({GC}). {GC} is developed on the basis of the willingness to pay ({WTP}) of rural commuters with respect to various attributes of rural feeder service. The work demonstrates the effect of catchment characteristics (i.e., number of villages, size of villages, and spatial separation represented by road network connecting villages to bus stop) on feeder service attributes (i.e., type of vehicle, route, headway of service and fare). It is also shown that planning of feeder service could be instrumental in bringing benefits to rural communities. The results presented in the paper are case specific, but the methodology can be applied to the planning of feeder services in other rural regions. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){TE}.1943-5436.0000419. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.}

      \field{abstract}{In rural areas with low demand, demand responsive transport ({DRT}) can provide an alternative to the regular public transport bus lines, which are expensive to operate in such conditions. With simulation, we explore the potential effects of introducing a {DRT} service that replaces existing bus lines in Lolland municipality in Denmark, assuming that the existing demand remains unchanged. We set up the {DRT} service in such a way that its service quality (in terms of waiting time and in-vehicle time) is comparable to the replaced buses. The results show that a {DRT} service can be more cost efficient than regular buses and can produce significantly less {CO}2 emissions when the demand level is low. Additionally, we analyse the demand density at which regular buses become more cost efficient and explore how the target service quality of a {DRT} service can affect operational characteristics. Overall, we argue that {DRT} could be a more sustainable mode of public transport in low demand areas.}

      \field{abstract}{Due to modern communication and information technology, shared taxi services are on the rise. While most research and practical projects focus on services operating in densely populated areas, the advantages of individual, flexible and shared transportation services in sparsely populated urban areas have not been well explored yet. Using a constraint programming formulation, this work investigates request management policies to evaluate the economic potential of shared taxi services. Computational experiments simulate such services under various effective degrees of dynamism and demonstrate the impact of pre-bookings on their efficiency and service quality in rural areas.}

Nevertheless, to apply this kind of service successfully efficient algorithms have to be implemented for effective fleet management to exploit the benefits associated with this mobility service. Especially real time computation of finding beneficial assignments is a problem not solved for large problem sizes until today. In this study, we show the importance of using advanced algorithms by comparing a fast, but simple insertion heuristic algorithm with a state-of-the-art multi-step matching algorithm. We test the algorithms in various scenarios based on private vehicle trip {OD}-data for Munich, Germany. Results indicate that in the tested scenarios by using the multi-step algorithm up to 8\${\textbackslash}\%\$ additional requests could be served while also 10\${\textbackslash}\%\$ additional driven distance could be saved. However, computational time for finding optimal assignments in the advanced algorithm exceeds real time rather fast as problem size increases. Therefore, several aspects to reduce the computational time by decreasing redundant checks of the advanced multi step algorithm are introduced. Finally, a refined vehicle selection heuristic based on three rules is presented to furthermore reduce the computational effort. In the tested scenarios this heuristic can speed up the most cost intensive algorithm step by a factor of over 8, while keeping the number of served requests almost constant and maintaining around 70\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the driven distance saved in the system. Considering all algorithm steps, an overall speed up of 2.5 could be achieved.}

      \field{abstract}{On-Demand Ride-Pooling services have the potential to increase traffic efficiency compared to private vehicle trips by decreasing parking space needed and increasing vehicle occupancy due to higher vehicle utilization and shared trips, respectively. Thereby, an operator controls a fleet of vehicles that serve requested trips on-demand while trips can be shared. In this highly dynamic and stochastic setting, asymmetric spatio-temporal request distributions can drive the system towards an imbalance between demand and supply when vehicles end up in regions with low demand. This imbalance would lead to low fleet utilization and high customer waiting times. This study proposes a novel rebalancing algorithm to predictively reposition idle fleet vehicles to reduce this imbalance. The algorithm first samples artificial requests from a predicted demand distribution and simulates future fleet states to identify supply shortages. An assignment problem is formulated that assigns repositioning trips considering multiple samples and forecast horizons. The algorithm is implemented in an agent-based simulation framework and compared to multiple state-of-the-art rebalancing algorithms. A case study for Chicago, Illinois shows the benefits of applying the repositioning strategy by increasing service rate and vehicle revenue hours by roughly 50\% compared to a service without repositioning. It additionally outperforms all comparison algorithms by serving more customers, increasing the pooling efficiency and decreasing customer waiting time regardless of the forecasting method applied. As a trade-off, the computational time increases, but with a termination within a couple of seconds it is still applicable for large-scale real world instances.}

      \field{abstract}{Ride Parcel Pooling ({RPP}) is the integrated transportation of passengers and parcels. It builds on what's known as on-demand ride-pooling, which dynamically assigns customer trips to fleet vehicles in real time, sharing their rides, and thus aiming to save on driving distances and fleet size compared to on-demand ride-hailing services. In the case of {RPP}, a additional parcel demand is introduced that is less sensitive to longer travel and waiting times and is less negatively affected by changing vehicles. In this case, parcels are served with a lower priority than passengers and simply ride along with appropriate passenger trips. This makes it possible to achieve a more efficient use of vehicle capacity and further reduce the total distance traveled for passenger and logistics mobility. This research is divided into a conceptual and scenario definition part to define the proposed service and develop possible operational scenarios, a theoretical simulation-based approach to quantify the potential of the proposed {RPP} service, and a practical field test to investigate its real-world applicability. Agent-based {RPP} simulations show that the integration of logistics services into a ride-pooling service is possible and can exploit unused system capacity without degrading passenger service. Depending on the assignment strategies, parcels can be served up to a parcel-to-passenger demand ratio of 1:10, while total fleet kilometers can be reduced compared to the status quo, as the additional mileage for logistics service can be fully integrated. In the base scenario of the simulation, approximately 50,000 passengers and 5,000 parcels are transported by a fleet of 600 cars or 1,200 rickshaws. The {RPP} field test included a mobile phone web app and five bicycle rickshaws offering the {RPP} service in the Maxvorstadt district in Munich, Germany. Each rickshaw had two passenger seats and additional space for parcels. The service was available daily between 11:00 and 19:00 for one week and was completely free for users. The field test showed that the {RPP} service is ready to operate today and provided interesting insights into the real-world operational parameters for such a service.}

      \field{abstract}{Ride-sourcing companies have worsened congestion in numerous cities worldwide, as many users are attracted from more sustainable modes. To reverse this trend, it is crucial to leverage the technology of connecting users and vehicles online and use it to strengthen public transport, which can be achieved by integrating on-demand pooled services with existing fixed-line services. We propose an efficient and practical integration idea: namely, to complement fixed bus lines with a fleet of smaller vehicles that follow flexible (on-demand) routes side-by-side with the fixed routes, so that part of the demand that would have used the fixed line can ride the flexible service instead. With this scheme, a smaller bus fleet is required, partially compensating for the increase in operators’ costs stemming from the flexible vehicles. This integration strategy favors mostly two types of users: those traveling in low-demand periods, through lower waiting times, and those located far from the bus stops, because the on-demand vehicles can reduce their access time. We develop simulations in real-world scenarios from Santiago, Chile, and Berlin, Germany, for the cases of human-driven and automated vehicles. Results show that when vehicles are automated: (i) A small number of on-demand vehicles can reduce average walking times from approximately 12 to 2 min while reducing operators’ costs, leading to a Pareto improvement, (ii) A larger number of on-demand vehicles can diminish total costs by 13\%–39\%, through a reduction in users’ costs, although increasing operators’ costs. If vehicles are not automated, total costs are reduced by more than 10\% in all of the scenarios analyzed, but a Pareto improvement is not always possible. In general, this mixed fixed/on-demand system outperforms the use of on-demand ridepooling only. Results are more promising in Berlin, because large buses are cheaper in Santiago and run more crowded, so it is more costly to partially replace them by smaller vehicles.}

      \field{abstract}{Urban transit systems usually operate according to fixed-route and fixed-schedule schemes by employing fixed-capacity vehicles, despite the mobility demand is unevenly spread out in both space and time. Modular buses are an emerging technology in which modules of relatively small capacity can be dynamically docked together to form greater capacity buses and can, therefore, make the transit system capable of adapting the capacity to the actual mobility demand. A module can be shifted from one line to another at pre-defined intersections and can be relocated when empty, if beneficial. We call these two operations sharing and rebalancing, respectively. Given a transit network comprising multiple bus lines and a mobility demand, we present an integer linear program to determine an optimal assignment of modules to lines, so that the mobility demand is met with a minimum total number of modules. Computational experiments show that, by exploiting the flexibility of modular buses, the total capacity deployed can be reduced by 49\% with respect to a conventional transit system, whereas the average occupancy ratio increases from 41.22\% to 72.85\%.}

      \field{abstract}{Urban mobility impacts urban life to a great extent. To enhance urban mobility, much research was invested in traveling time prediction: given an origin and destination, provide a passenger with an accurate estimation of how long a journey lasts. In this work, we investigate a novel combination of methods from Queueing Theory and Machine Learning in the prediction process. We propose a prediction engine that, given a scheduled bus journey (route) and a ‘source/destination’ pair, provides an estimate for the traveling time, while considering both historical data and real-time streams of information that are transmitted by buses. We propose a model that uses natural segmentation of the data according to bus stops and a set of predictors, some use learning while others are learning-free, to compute traveling time. Our empirical evaluation, using bus data that comes from the bus network in the city of Dublin, demonstrates that the snapshot principle, taken from Queueing Theory, works well yet suffers from outliers. To overcome the outliers problem, we use Machine Learning techniques as a regulator that assists in identifying outliers and propose prediction based on historical data.}

      \field{abstract}{Feeder services are public transit services that transport people from a low demand, typically suburban, area to a high demand area, such as a transportation hub or a city. Here, passengers continue their journey using traditional forms of public transport. On the one hand, on-demand feeder services have been a topic of discussion in a number of recent studies, since these services can serve the demand efficiently. On the other hand, traditional feeder services with predetermined routes and timetables provide predictability and easier cost control. In this paper, a demand-responsive feeder service is considered, which combines positive characteristics of both traditional services as well as on-demand-only services. This feeder service has mandatory bus stops which are always serviced, as well as optional bus stops which are only serviced when there is demand for transportation nearby. To optimize the performance of this feeder service, a large neighborhood search heuristic is developed. Experimental results on 14 benchmark instances illustrate that the {LNS} algorithm obtains solutions with an average gap of 1\% or less compared to the optimal solution, within 1s of runtime. Larger instances can also be solved, typically in less than 60s. The results also show that the demand-responsive feeder service generally outperforms a traditional service in terms of service quality, often by more than 60\%.}

      \field{abstract}{Public transportation out of suburban or rural areas is crucial. Feeder transportation services offer a solution by transporting passengers to areas where more options for public transport are available. On one hand, fully flexible demand-responsive feeder services ({DRFSs}) efficiently tailor their service to the needs of the passengers. On the other hand, traditional feeder services provide predictability and easier cost control. In this article, a semi-flexible {DRFS} is considered, which combines positive characteristics of both traditional services as well as fully flexible services. This feeder service has two types of bus stops: mandatory bus stops and optional bus stops. Mandatory bus stops are guaranteed to be visited by a bus within a certain time interval. Optional stops are only visited when there is demand for transportation nearby. The performance of this feeder service is optimized with the use of a new type of metaheuristic framework, which we denote as parameter space search. Experimental results on small benchmark instances indicate that the heuristic performs on average 12.42\% better than {LocalSolver}, a commercial optimization solver, with an average runtime of 2.1 s. Larger instances can also be solved, typically within 2 min.}

      \field{abstract}{The transportation landscape is witnessing profound changes due to technological advancements, necessitating proactive policy responses to harness innovation and avert urban mobility disruption. The sharing economy has already transformed ridesharing, bicycle-sharing, and electric scooters, with shared autonomous vehicles ({SAVs}) poised to reshape car ownership. This study pursues two objectives: firstly, to establish a market segmentation for shared ride services and secondly, to evaluate the environmental impact of ridesharing in different contexts. To mitigate potential biases linked to stated preference data, we analysed the navette service, utilized by a research institute in Europe, closely resembling future {SAVs}. The market segmentation relied on hierarchical cluster analysis using employee survey responses, while the environmental analysis was grounded in the 2019 navette service data. Our analysis revealed four unique employee clusters: Cluster 1, emphasizing active transportation and environmental awareness; Cluster 2, showing openness towards {SAVs} given reliable alternatives are available; Cluster 3, the largest segment, highlighting a demand for policy support and superior service quality; and Cluster 4, which places a premium on time, suggesting a potential need for strategies to make the service more efficient and, consequently, discourage private car use. These findings highlight a general willingness to adopt shared transport modes, signalling a promising transition to shared vehicle ownership with significant environmental benefits achievable through service design and policy measures. © 2024 by the authors.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper presents a spatial approach to support the design of new on-demand flexible transport services in urban areas, characterized by inefficient public transport and modal imbalance in favour of private cars. These services, enabled by new technologies and inspired by the shared mobility paradigm, can complement and improve conventional public transport and reduce car use. The methodology was applied to Acireale, a small town in Southern Italy. A redesign of the existing bus network and its integration with a flexible service was formulated. A scenario analysis was carried out by the evaluation of a simple accessibility measure; the computation of the Gini coefficient was performed to measure the social equity of different scenarios. Results show an increase in equity with a lower coverage of traditional lines and the introduction of the on-demand service. This approach based on easy-to-understand indicators can help the strategic planning of such services, which have the potential to find a trade-off between ridership and coverage as both desirable and conflicting goals in public transport planning.}

      \field{abstract}{A review of tourism policy documents reveals three key objectives: environmental, social and economic sustainability. This paper examines the role of scheduled buses in meeting these objectives, using data from a large survey of bus passengers in rural tourist destinations. It ﬁnds that buses achieve modest modal shift from cars, allow access to the countryside for people without cars and generate spending in local economies. It suggests how these functions could be improved by market-segmentation, better publicity and service delivery and questions why many such services struggle for funding each year.}

      \field{abstract}{The emerging customized bus system based on modular autonomous electric vehicles ({MAEVs}) shows tremendous potential to improve the mobility, accessibility and environmental friendliness of a public transport system. However, the existing studies in this area almost focus on human-driven vehicles which face some striking limitations (e.g., restricted crew scheduling and fixed vehicle capacity) and can weaken the overall benefits. This paper proposes a two-phase optimization procedure to fully unleash the potential of {MAEVs} by leveraging the strengths of {MAEVs}, including automatic allocation and charging of modules. In the first phase, a mixed integer programming model is established in the space-time-state framework to jointly optimize the {MAEV} routing and charging, passenger-to-vehicle assignment and vehicle capacity management for reserved passengers. A Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. In the second phase, three dispatching strategies are designed and optimized by a dynamic dispatching procedure to properly adapt the operation of {MAEVs} to emerging travel demands. A case study conducted on a major urban area of Beijing, China, demonstrates the high efficiency of the {MAEV} adoption in terms of resource utilization and environmental friendliness across a range of travel demand distributions, vehicle supply and module capacity scenarios.}

      \field{abstract}{The maturing of autonomous driving technology in recent years has led to several pilot projects and the initial integration of autonomous pods and buses into the public transport ({PT}) system. An emerging field of interest is the design of public transport networks operating autonomous buses and the potential to attract higher levels of travel demand. In this work a multi-objective optimization and multi-agent simulation framework is developed to study potential changes in the network design and frequency settings compared to conventional {PT} systems when autonomous vehicles ({AV}) systems are deployed on fixed-route networks. During the optimization process multiple deployment scenarios (network configurations and service frequency) are evaluated and optimized considering the operator cost, user cost and infrastructure preparation costs of the system. User-focused network design and operator-focused network design are studied for a real-world urban area in Sweden. The results provide insights into the network design and level of service implications brought about by the deployment of autonomous bus ({AB}) when those are integrated in route-based {PT} systems. We show that the deployment of autonomous buses result with a network design that increases service ridership. In the context of our case study this increase is likely to primarily substitute walking.}

      \field{abstract}{This contribution presents a flexible integrated transport system which features the combination of anticipated peer-to-peer ridesharing and state-licensed on-demand services, complementing fixed-line scheduled transit. A sequential method of estimating the demand potential of such a collaborative service structure versus its supply side is formalized and studied by simulating synthetic network models. The workflow is set to support planning, to prove the efficiency of integrated solutions, and to reduce uncertainties for market entrants.}

      \field{abstract}{Public transport in urban and suburban areas is not always able to meet population’s need of accessibility to jobs, education, health and other opportunities in terms of routes and frequencies; therefore, those who do not own a private vehicle, or who cannot afford individual public transport (e.g. taxis), are often in a condition of social exclusion. Taking advantages of new {ICT} tools and facilities, Demand Responsive Shared Transport ({DRST}) services can provide “on demand” transport gathering ride bookings of different users and routing a fleet of vehicles to satisfy passengers’ needs while minimizing the cost for the operator.}

      \field{abstract}{Shared mobility solutions improve traffic efficiency in cities. This paper addresses the design of an urban demand-responsive transit system operated by a fleet of autonomous modules as a public transportation service. We introduce a discrete event-based multi-agent simulation to reflect system dynamics at an operational level. Vehicles, customers, and intelligent stops are modeled as software agents. Each entity has its own decision-making and planning component. Vehicles compete for a limited number of order requests, and decentralized stops manage the matching between a customer and a prospective vehicle. Scheduling and routing events take place highly dynamically. A simulation study evaluates a demand-responsive operation as a replacement for a fixed-route bus service. Results show that a total demand of 2.3 million rides can be fulfilled with a fleet of around 43,000 six-seater modules. In comparison with the current bus system, the total energy consumption and the system’s utilization are improved, while transport times and distances result in values below the bus system’s performance and therefore must be optimized in further research.}

      \field{abstract}{This study proposes a methodology to optimize the assignment of an urban bus ﬂeet to a set of ﬁxed routes, taking into account the differences among routes and the differences among vehicle types and propulsion technologies in order to reduce pollutant emissions ({CO}2, {CO}, {THC}, {NOx} and {PM}). A Mixed Integer Linear Programming optimization model is stated and two scenarios are assessed: minimization of {CO}2 and {NOx}. The results show that it is feasible to obtain a ﬂeet distribution in which emissions for any given pollutant are reduced without increase in emissions of other pollutants.}

      \field{abstract}{Taxi is certainly the most popular type of on-demand transportation service in urban areas because taxi-dispatching systems offer more and better services in terms of shorter wait times and passenger travel convenience. However, a shortage of taxicabs has always been critical in many urban contexts especially during peak hours, and taxi has great potential to maximize its efficiency by employing the shared-ride concept. There are recent successes in dynamic ride-sharing projects that are expected to bring substantial benefits arising from energy consumption and operation efficiency and thus, it is essential to develop advanced shared-taxi-dispatch algorithms and investigate the collective benefits of dynamic ride-sharing by maximizing occupancy and minimizing travel times in real-time. This article investigates how taxi services can be improved by proposing shared-taxi algorithms and what type of objective functions and constraints could be employed to prevent excessive passenger detours. Hybrid-simulated annealing ({HSA}) is applied to dynamically assign passenger requests efficiently. A series of simulations are conducted with two different taxi operation strategies. The simulation results reveal that allowing ride-sharing for taxicabs increases productivity over the various demand levels and {HSA} can be considered as a suitable solution to maximize the system efficiency of dynamic ride-sharing.}

      \field{abstract}{To provide efficient public transportation services in areas with high demand variability over time, it may be desirable to switch vehicles between conventional services (with fixed routes and schedules) during peak periods and flexible route services during low-demand periods. This option is called variable-type services. Conventional, flexible, and variable-type service alternatives optimized for various conditions are compared to explore when variable-type bus services might be preferable to purely conventional or flexible service. The optimization models used for purely conventional or flexible service are adapted from previous studies. These models are integrated into a new model for optimizing variable-type bus service. The results of sensitivity analyses show how demand variability over time and other factors affect the relative effectiveness of conventional, flexible, and variable-type bus services. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){TE}.1943-5436.0000326.

      \field{abstract}{Conventional bus service (with ﬁxed routes and schedules) has lower average cost than ﬂexible bus service (with demand-responsive routes) at high demand densities. At low demand densities ﬂexible bus service has lower average costs and provides convenient door-to-door service. Bus size and operation type are related since larger buses have lower average cost per passenger at higher demand densities. The operation type and other decisions are jointly optimized here for a bus transit system connecting a major terminal to local regions. Conventional and ﬂexible bus sizes, conventional bus route spacings, areas of service zones for ﬂexible buses, headways, and ﬂeet sizes are jointly optimized in multi-dimensional nonlinear mixed integer optimization problems. To solve them, we propose a hybrid approach, which combines analytic optimization with a Genetic Algorithm. Numerical analysis conﬁrms that the proposed method provides near-optimal solutions and shows how the proposed Mixed Fleet Variable Type Bus Operation ({MFV}) can reduce total cost compared to alternative operations such as Single Fleet Conventional Bus ({SFC}), Single Fleet Flexible Bus ({SFF}), Mixed Fleet Conventional Bus ({MFC}) and Mixed Fleet Flexible Bus ({MFF}). With consistent system-wide bus sizes, capital costs are reduced by sharing ﬂeets over times and over regions. The sensitivity of results to several important parameters is also explored.}

      \field{abstract}{Demand Responsive Transit ({DRT}) is gaining attention as a flexible and efficient solution for connecting urban transit hubs, but challenges such as travel time variability and punctuality remain significant barriers. This study develops a robust optimization framework with variable travel speed to address these issues, minimizing user and operator costs while reducing transfer waiting times. The framework incorporates variable travel speeds and employs a genetic algorithm to optimize routes and operations compared to many studies using constant commercial speed. Experiments conducted in Hwaseong, South Korea, analyzed scenarios with varying service rates, vehicle capacities, and detour ratios. Results show that implementing punctuality-constrained {DRT} reduces total travel times by 14\% compared to subways and 36\% compared to buses, highlighting its potential to significantly improve user convenience and operational efficiency. The findings suggest that carefully designed {DRT} systems with highly reliable punctuality can enhance urban mobility by integrating seamlessly with existing transit networks, providing a cost-effective and reliable alternative to traditional public transport.}

      \field{abstract}{Demand Responsive Transport ({DRT}) systems are often discussed to expand public transport in rural areas, where conventional buses are often used below capacity. {DRT} systems can particularly improve the mobility situation for less mobile people or other people who depend on public transport and ultimately prevent them from social exclusion. This paper examines whether people who show characteristics that indicate a mobility deficit are more willing to access the {DRT} system {EcoBus} in a rural area of Germany. Using survey data from 156 respondents from households in the {EcoBus} service area and utilizing linear regression analysis, this study confirms that car availability harms the intended use of {DRT} and that physical impairment has a positive effect, as identified several times in the literature. Furthermore, the influence of age on the intended {EcoBus} use depends on the residence place’s city size and hence on its offer of daily public services. While residents of a sub-centre of the region are significantly less willing to use the {EcoBus} with increasing age, there is an opposite tendency for small villages. Thus, in small inaccessible localities, the likelihood of using {EcoBus} increases with age, suggesting that {DRT} systems benefit the doubly constrained population, namely the elderly population in localities with few public services.}

      \field{abstract}{Public ridepooling systems could contribute to the reduction of traffic volume and emissions in cities by decreasing the number of rides by private car while increasing the average number of passengers per vehicle. Yet, it is unknown how urban travelers value different attributes of the ridepooling’s operational concept. Which characteristics of ridepooling concepts are most important to the users? In order to obtain a deeper understanding of travelers’ preferences concerning a ridepooling system, choice-based Conjoint Analysis was performed. Based on a literature review and a focus group, six relevant attributes of the operational concept of ridepooling systems were determined: fare, walking distance, time of booking, shift of departure time, travel time, and information provision. Data from 237 German city dwellers were analyzed with the help of Cox regression. Except for time of booking, all service attributes significantly affected the respondents’ choice. Besides the high relevance of fare, the results underline the particular importance of the attribute walking distance to the pick-up point for elderly. The results give guidance for the creation of user-centered public transport systems that meet the requirements of the prospective passengers and thus might contribute to the development of shared passenger transport systems for sustainable urban mobility.}

      \field{abstract}{The introduction of shared autonomous vehicles ({SAV}) will likely reduce operation cost per vehicle and might thereby allow to enhance conventional public transit systems with numerous small {SAVs} oﬀering ﬂexible ridesharing-like feeder services. These demand-responsive services could replace conventional bus lines limited by their ﬁxed routes and their ﬁxed schedules. This simulation study explores the potential of replacing conventional bus lines with shared autonomous vehicles in a suburban area of Berlin. Several scenarios with diﬀerent ﬂeet sizes and vehicle sizes are simulated using the multi agent transport simulation {MATSim}. The simulation suggests for all evaluated scenarios higher operating costs and only slight travel time savings in comparison to conventional buses. Door-to-door service allows for signiﬁcant reductions in average walk time, but causes numerous detours which consume a high share of the time gained. A ﬂeet of 150 {SAVs} with 4 seats each seemed appropriate for the simulated area with approximately 24 000 inhabitants.}

      \field{abstract}{We propose to solve a real-time traffic variation of the On-Demand Bus Routing Problem ({ODBRP}) introduced by Melis and Sörensen (2022). The {ODBRP} belongs to the category of the Dial-A-Ride Problems ({DARP}), and features departure and arrival bus station selection. This problem is specifically aimed at planning a fleet of on-demand buses in an urban environment. However, cities are frequently plagued by traffic congestion, which may cause delays and missed time windows for passengers. To deal with this situation, we introduce, study, and solve a variant of the {ODBRP} in which the travel times are both time-dependent (i.e., the travel time between two nodes depends on the departure time) and updated dynamically. In our approach, congested roads that might cause passenger delays are modeled by frequently updating the travel speed on the road segments that constitute them. The resulting problem is solved by using a K-shortest-path procedure to determine alternative paths between bus stations, as well as a Variable Neighborhood Descent ({VND}) procedure to repair violated time windows. Our experimental results show the overall efficacy of this real-time control under divergent degrees of flexibility (congestion and the number of buses available). Specifically, the average tardiness, maximum tardiness, and the number of late passengers are significantly reduced under a wide range of congestion scenarios, from slight to severe. In addition, this efficacy holds for various ratios of requests to the number of vehicles.}

      \field{abstract}{In this paper, we study the dial-a-ride problem of ride-sharing automated taxis ({ATs}) in an urban road network, considering the traffic congestion caused by the {ATs}. This shared automated mobility system is expected to provide a seamless door-to-door service for urban travellers, much like what the existing transportation network companies ({TNC}) do, but with decreased labour cost and more flexible relocation operations due to the vehicles’ automation. We propose an integer non-linear programming ({INLP}) model that optimizes the routing of the {ATs} to maximize the system profit, depending on dynamic travel times, which are a non-linear function of the {ATs}’ flows. It is important to involve traffic congestion in such a routing problem since for a growing number of {ATs} circulating in the city their number will lead to delays. The model is embedded within a rolling horizon framework, which divides a typical day into several horizons to deal with the real-time travel demand. In each horizon, the routing model is solved with the demand at that interval and assuring the continuity of the trips between horizons. Nevertheless, each horizon model is hard to solve given its number of constraints and decision variables. Therefore, we propose a solution approach based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, which allows identifying a near-optimal solution for this difficult problem. Numerical experiments for the city of Delft, The Netherlands, are used to demonstrate the solution quality of the proposed algorithm as well as obtaining insights about the {AT} system performance. Results show that the solution algorithm can solve the proposed model for hard instances. Ride-sharing makes the {AT} system more capable to provide better service regarding delay time and the number of requests that can be attended by the system. The delay penalty on the profit objective function is an effective control parameter on guaranteeing the service quality while maintaining system profitability.}

      \field{abstract}{Shared autonomous vehicles are rapidly becoming one of the most popular topics in the fields of transportation and operations research. This paper studies a prospective transportation system in which shared autonomous vehicles ({SAVs}) providing Dial-a-Ride services in urban and rural areas must meet a large number of passenger requests (at least 105 per day). We consider those {SAVs} likely to replace, in the future, most of the individual vehicles inside urban areas. We address this very large-scale problem with a greedy insertion heuristic that involves a specific filtering system design in order to speed up the decision process and relies on an original network-driven encoding of the routes. Experimental results show that en-route vehicles can be drastically reduced by such systems using a fleet of {SAVs} of capacity 10, decreasing the vehicle number by more than 98\%, compared to a situation where all travel demands would rely on personal vehicles. In addition, thanks to the filtering system, the total execution time can be reduced by almost 97\% compared to the classic best-fit insertion heuristic, while maintaining the quality of the solution. This opens the way to the adaptation of our algorithms to a dynamic real-time context.}

      \field{abstract}{In recent years, an innovative mode of public transport ({PT}) service, known as customized bus ({CB}), has been springing up across China. This service, providing advanced, personalized and ﬂexible demandresponsive {PT}, is offered to speciﬁc clientele, especially commuters. The present work analyzes, for the ﬁrst time, the evolution of this new {PT} concept across 30 Chinese cities where {CB} systems are currently in operation or under construction. Unlike conventional bus transit service, {CB} users are actively involved in various operational planning activities. {CB} personalizes {PT} service by using interactive and integrated information platforms, such as internet website, telephone and smartphone. The analysis comprises three components: ﬁrst, a comprehensive examination of the background of {CB} and its temporal and spatial distribution in China; second, an analysis of the operation-planning process, including elements of online demand collection, network route design, timetable development, vehicle scheduling, crew scheduling, real-time control, and fare design and collection: third, a summary of the results of the examination and analysis, presenting pros, cons and recommendations. The successful implementation of {CB} in China demonstrates that this new {PT} service concept can effectively meet the ever-increasing mobility needs of large populations nation-wide. Similarly, the present work can provide a valuable reference for policymakers, academic researchers, {PT} practitioners and others worldwide.}

      \field{abstract}{In the realm of mobility services, high-capacity ridesharing such as buspooling holds promise in alleviating the overuse of low-capacity cars and addressing accessibility bottlenecks to public transit systems. However, research on buspooling remains in its fancy stage, requiring dedicated efforts to quantify and enhance its potential benefits. In this paper, we propose car-user-oriented and sustainable operating principles and embody them in a passenger matching model. Furthermore, we employ a solution approach including the spatial-temporal pruning strategies and a heuristic algorithm to guarantee the efficiency of larger-scale computing. Applying this system to the case of Beijing, results demonstrate that buspooling services could yield significant benefits to passengers, operators, and the environment. The consistency observed between the distribution of taxi trips and bus routes suggests that buspooling could effectively enhance subway accessibility, especially for residents in suburban areas. Moreover, findings from a sophisticated analysis can inform the design of a more attractive and ecofriendly system for intermodal transit services in practice.}

      \field{abstract}{On-demand multi-passenger shared transport options are increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to reduce traffic congestion and emissions and improve the convenience and travel experience for passengers. These services, often referred to as on-demand public transport, are aimed at meeting personal travel demands through the use of shared vehicles that run on flexible routes using advanced tools for dynamic scheduling. This paper presents an agent-based traffic simulation model that was developed to evaluate the performance of on-demand public transport and compare it with existing scheduled bus services using a case study of the inner city of Melbourne in Australia. The key performance measures used in the comparative evaluation included quality of service and passenger experience in terms of waiting times, the efficiency of service and operations in terms of hourly vehicle utilization, and system efficiency in terms of trip completion rates, passenger kilometers travelled and total passenger trip times. The results showed significant benefits for passengers who use on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services. The on-demand bus service was found to reduce average total passenger waiting times by 89\% during the Morning Peak; by 78\% during the Mid-Day period; by 81\% during the Afternoon Peak; and by more than 95\% during other periods of the day. From an operator’s perspective, the on-demand services were found to achieve around 70\% vehicle utilization rates during peak hours compared to a utilization rate not exceeding 16\% for the scheduled bus services. Even during off-peak periods, the occupancies for on-demand services were almost twice the vehicle occupancies for scheduled bus services. In terms of system efficiency, the on-demand services achieved a trip completion rate of 85\% compared to a trip completion rate of 67\% for the scheduled bus services. The total passenger-kilometers travelled was similar for both scheduled and on-demand bus services, which refutes claims that on-demand bus services induce more kilometers of travel. The trip completion times were around 55\% shorter for on-demand bus services compared to scheduled services, which represents a significant saving in travel time for users. Finally, the paper presents average emissions per completed trip for both types of services and shows a significant reduction in emissions for on-demand services compared to conventional bus services. These include, on average, a 48\% reduction in {CO}2 emissions per trip; 82\% reduction in {NO} emissions per trip; and 41\% reduction in p.m.10 emissions per trip. These findings clearly demonstrate the superior benefits of on-demand bus services compared to scheduled bus services.}

      \field{abstract}{Detours are considered key for the efficient operation of a shared rides service, but they are also a major pain point for consumers of such services. This paper studies the relationship between the value generated by shared rides and the detours they create for riders. We establish a limit on the sum of value and detour, and we prove that this leads to a tight bound on the Pareto frontier of values and detours in a general setting with an arbitrary number of requests. We explicitly compute the Pareto frontier for one family of city topologies and construct it via simulation for several more networks, including one based on ride-sharing data from commute hours in Manhattan. We find that average detours are usually small, even in low-demand-density settings. We also find that by carefully choosing the match objective, detours can be reduced with a relatively small impact on values and that the density of ride requests is far more important than detours for the effective operations of a shared rides service. In response, we propose that platforms implement a two-product version of shared rides and limit the worst-case detours of its users. This paper was accepted by Hamid Nazerzadeh, data science.

      \field{abstract}{In rural areas with low population density, demand-responsive transport ({DRT}) is considered a promising alternative to conventional public transport ({PT}). With a fleet of smaller vehicles, {DRT} provides a much more flexible and convenient service. This characteristic makes {DRT} also a potential mode of transport to serve students in rural areas. If {DRT} vehicles are used to serve students, then the funding for conventional school buses (or adapted public transport schedules) can be reinvested in the {DRT} system. This may help to relieve the financial burden experienced by {DRT} operators and enable the operation of a large-scale {DRT} service in rural areas. In this study, a demand model for school commutes based on real-world, open-source data for Landkreis Vulkaneifel, a rural region in Germany, is built. Then a feasibility study is carried out using an agent-based transport simulation framework. In the feasibility study, various setups and operational schemes are explored, which are followed by a systematic cost analysis. Based on a conservative estimation, an annual budget of around 1600 Euro per student will be needed to maintain and operate a fleet of {DRT} vehicles that can transport all the students in the region from home to school on time in the morning. During the remaining time of the day and on school holidays, the vehicles can be used for conventional {DRT} service for the public.}

      \field{abstract}{To improve the accessibility of transit system in urban areas, this paper presents a flexible feeder transit routing model that can serve irregular-shaped networks. By integrating the cost efficiency of fixed-route transit system and the flexibility of demand responsive transit system, the proposed model is capable of letting operating feeder busses temporarily deviate from their current route so as to serve the reported demand locations. With an objective of minimizing total bus travel time, a new operational mode is then proposed to allow busses to serve passengers on both street sides. In addition, when multiple feeder busses are operating in the target service area, the proposed model can provide an optimal plan to locate the nearest one to response to the demands. A three-stage solution algorithm is also developed to yield meta-optimal solutions to the problem in a reasonable amount of time by transforming the problem into a traveling salesman problem. Numerical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model as well as the heuristic solution approach. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Rural mobility has a lack of innovative proposals in contrast with its urban counterpart. This research aims to bring solutions that ease the implementation of reliable and flexible rural transportation. Demand-responsive transportation is chosen to develop a public transportation service providing interurban trips among several rural settlements. Given the characteristics of rural displacement demand, a novel approach is introduced to optimize the service’s economic costs: the dynamic transfer point allocation. The problem is fully formulated and an architecture is introduced describing the workflow of the whole system. Data from an interurban bus transportation service are used to build a case study of a rural area of Valencia, Spain, and develop several examples illustrating the benefits of the proposed approach. The results reveal that the dynamic creation of transfer points can simplify the transportation fleet’s itineraries and boost the amount of served travel requests. Finally, a discussion of the benefits and dangers of flexible features in rural transportation is developed, underscoring the need to achieve a balance between dynamic operation and service quality.}

      \field{abstract}{Rural mobility research has been left aside in favor of urban transportation. Rural areas’ low demand, the distance among settlements, and an older population on average make conventional public transportation inefficient and costly. This paper assesses the contribution that on-demand mobility has the potential to make to rural areas. First, demand-responsive transportation is described, and the related literature is reviewed to gather existing system configurations. Next, we describe and implement a proposal and test it on a simulation basis. The results show a clear potential of the demand-responsive mobility paradigm to serve rural demand at an acceptable quality of service. Finally, the results are discussed, and the issues of adoption rate and input data scarcity are addressed.}

      \field{abstract}{The provision of public transit services is essential to provide citizens with an improved quality of life. The most popular fixed route bus service ({FRBS}) is intended to serve a large population along with fixed stops, routes, and schedules. However, in low demand conditions, bus transit operators pay a high cost per passenger to maintain the desired level of service. A demand-responsive transit ({DRT}) is a commonly discussed transportation solution for serving low passenger demand. Although the conventional {DRT} system offers a shared-ride door-to-door service to passengers, its implementation is challenging and expensive during peak hours. The present study suggests a form of transit system that combines the rigidity of {FRBS} and flexibility of {DRT} to operate in low demand routes. This defined category of transit service is referred to as semi-flexible transit ({SFT}) system. The proposed {SFT} service is delivered along the fixed bus route and a limited number of fixed stops based on a flexible schedule to meet passenger requests. The defined {SFT} system offers reduced operating time and higher vehicle utilization. The study considers an operation of the proposed {SFT} service for two types of service delivery systems: Contract-Out Taxi Service ({COTS}), and In-House Paratransit Service ({IHPS}). A methodology is proposed to develop analytical models describing operational costs of regular {FRBS}, {COTS}, and {IHPS} as a function of demand or annual ridership. Operating cost models are proposed as a decision support tool to enable transit planners to determine the passenger demands along the route at which it is justifiable to “switch” from {FRBS} to the {SFT} system to minimize the total cost of operation. Further, the analysis results for {FRBS} indicate that operating costs are strongly related to vehicle-service hours and for {SFT} services to average vehicle occupancy rate and deadheading time. Applications of the proposed models and analysis method are demonstrated for a low demand route in the City of Regina.}

      \field{abstract}{Transport-on-demand services, such as demand-responsive transport ({DRT}), involve a flexible transportation service that offers convenient and personalised mobility choices for public transport users. Integrating {DRT} with mobile data and data analytics enhances understanding of travel patterns and allows the development of improved algorithms to support design-optimised services. This study introduces a replicable framework for {DRT} that employs an on-demand transport simulator and routing algorithm. This framework is supported by a mobile data set, enabling a more accurate service design grounded on actual demand data. Decision-makers can use this framework to understand traffic patterns better and test a {DRT} solution before implementing it in the actual world. A case study was conducted in Porto, Portugal, to demonstrate its practicality and proof of concept. Results show that the {DRT} solution required 135\% fewer stops and travelled 81\% fewer kilometres than the existing fixed-line service. Findings highlight the potential of this data-driven framework for urban public transportation systems to improve key performance metrics in required buses, energy consumption, travelled distance, and stop frequency, all while maintaining the number of served passengers. Under specific circumstances, embracing this approach can offer a more efficient, user-centric, and environmentally sustainable urban transportation service.}

      \field{abstract}{As a result of the lack of access to efficient public transit in suburban areas, residents often have to use their own vehicles to commute either within the area, to neighboring regions, or to a public transit hub ({PTH}). Thanks to information and communication technologies, on-demand transit ({ODT}) is a potential solution being proposed and considered by transit agencies. Although {ODT} has shown the potential to enhance transit level of service, its efficiency depends on different parameters such as demand spatial and temporal distribution or the configuration of the service. In this study, we propose a novel configuration for an {ODT} service and apply it to the first part of a commuter’s trip, or the commuter’s “first mile.” The proposed configuration depends on the availability of smart devices installed at bus stops. Passengers request their rides via smart devices and receive real-time and personalized information about their ride requests to travel to a {PTH}. The proposed {ODT} service is modeled with the Simulation of Urban Mobility or {SUMO} simulation framework. To evaluate the performance of the {ODT} service, it is applied to the city of Terrebonne in Quebec, Canada. The proposed service is compared with existing bus transit operating in the area as well as a door-to-{PTH} service. The results of the comparison analysis reveal that the proposed {ODT} service may result in a significant 36\% reduction in total travel time as well as a 41\% reduction in detour time compared with the existing bus transit service. A detailed sensitivity analysis is also conducted to capture the impacts of different parameters, variables, and dispatching algorithms on the service performance.}

      \field{abstract}{Semi-flexible transit ({SFT}) is commonly discussed as a cost-effective alternative to serving public transportation users in low-demand conditions. We hypothesize that joint optimization of service headway and slack time per trip for route deviation is essential for designing a schedule for the operation of an integrated {SFT} that can meet both fixed-route and paratransit demand. An integrated {SFT} has the potential to lower the cost of transportation for regular transit users (both operators and riders) while redirecting potential paratransit riders to less expensive transit modes; thus, reducing demand for overwhelmed paratransit services operating with limited resources. The optimization problem has three competing objectives: minimizing operator costs, minimizing user costs, and maximizing service benefits. Two state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms {NSGA}-{II} and {SMPSO} are compared to obtain the most representative deterministic Pareto optimal solution set. This study has three major contributions. First, quantile regression is used to suggest multiple slack time values for a given headway that transit planners can consider when generating a static schedule for {SFT} operation. Second, relationships derived to analyze cost trade-offs suggest that headway governs operator cost and is negatively correlated, user cost is positively and equally influenced by both variables, and slack time governs service benefit and is positively correlated. Third, sensitivity analysis for an integrated {SFT} operation reveals that low-capacity minivans and standard vans offer higher vehicle occupancy and cost efficiency, mostly economical for low to medium demand (5-20 pass/hr), low permissible deviation from the fixed route is desirable during peak hours to avoid delays for passengers on-board, and extreme weather conditions dramatically and negatively influence costs. Policy recommendations for integrated {SFT} implementation include a recommendation for fare structure design addressing service equity through surcharges/discounts, vehicle technology and service booking technology advancements for cost reduction, and fleet mix design through estimation of passenger loading profile. The application of the study methodology is demonstrated for a low-demand bus route in Regina, Canada.}

      \field{abstract}{In low-demand areas, semi-flexible transit system ({SFT}) operated by battery electric vehicles ({BEVs}) can reduce operational costs and achieve zero emissions, allowing {SFT} to be used more widely, and transit agencies to benefit more significantly. This paper is aimed at analyzing the effect of the additional requirements of {BEVs} on the cost efficiency of {SFT} services while considering different headways and slack time to accommodate route-deviation. Analytical models are used for detailed estimation of the total cost, including operator, user, and environmental costs, allowing a comparison with internal combustion engine ({ICEV}) vehicle technology, and three vehicle sizes: minivans, standard vans, and minibuses. Study results can be used to evaluate budget requirements to upgrade an existing {ICEV} based standard bus service along an underperforming low demand route to a {BEV} based {SFT} service. The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated for a low-demand bus route in Regina, Canada.}

      \field{abstract}{Dial-a-ride problems consist of designing vehicle routes and time schedules in a system of demand-dependent, collective people transportation. In the standard problem, operational costs are minimized, subject to full demand satisfaction and service level requirements. However, to enhance the practical applicability of solution methods, authors increasingly focus on problem variants that adopt additional real-life characteristics. First, this work introduces an up-to-date classification that distinguishes multiple categories of real-life characteristics. Second, the wide range of solution methods proposed in the literature is reviewed in a structured manner. Although the existing literature is reviewed exhaustively, specific attention is devoted to recent developments. Third, an extensive overview table provides full details on all problem characteristics and solution methods applied in each paper discussed. Fourth, lacunae in research conducted to date and opportunities for future work are identified.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper evaluates Integrated-Demand Responsive Transport (I-{DRT}) as a solution to the challenges faced by traditional public transport ({PT}) systems in low-demand urban areas. The study investigates the implications of replacing local {PT} with I-{DRT} in low-demand urban areas. A multi-objective model, incorporating operational cost, environmental impact, passengers’ travel time, and inequity is used to simulate the I-{DRT} performance. The analysis compares the performance of I-{DRT} and existing local bus lines in Belconnen, Canberra, Australia, based on number of utilised vehicles, operational cost, fuel consumption, average travel time, individual passenger travel time, delay, and inequity in delay distribution.}

      \field{abstract}{The term Demand-Responsive Transport ({DRT}) has been increasingly applied in the last 10 years to a niche market that replaces or feeds (usually via small low ﬂoor buses or taxis) conventional transport where demand is low and often spread over a large area. More recently, the concept of {DRT} as a niche market has been broadened to include a wider range of ﬂexible, demand-responsive transport services and is increasingly referred to as Flexible Transport Services ({FTSs}). The contention of this paper is that well-implemented {FTS} has the potential to revitalise bus-based public transport services which are traditionally based on ﬁxed networks with variable geographical coverage and levels of service.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper investigates the potential of autonomous minibuses which take on-demand directional routes for pick-up and drop-off in a grid network of wider area with low density, followed by fixed routes in areas with greater demand. Mathematical formulation for generalized costs demonstrates its benefits, with indicators proposed to select existing bus routes for conversion with the options of zonal express and parallel routes. Simulations on modeled scenarios and case studies with bus routes in Chicago show reductions in both passenger costs and generalized costs compared with existing fixed-route bus services between suburban areas and the central business district.}

      \field{abstract}{Public transit structure is traditionally designed to contain ﬁxed bus routes and predetermined bus stations. This paper presents an alternative ﬂexible-route transit system, in which each bus is allowed to travel across a predetermined area to serve passengers, while these bus service areas collectively form a hybrid ‘‘grand’’ structure that resembles huband-spoke and grid networks. We analyze the agency and user cost components of this proposed system in idealized square cities and seek the optimum network layout, service area of each bus, and bus headway, to minimize the total system cost. We compare the performance of the proposed transit system with those of comparable systems (e.g., ﬁxedroute transit network and taxi service), and show how each system is advantageous under certain passenger demand levels. It is found out that under low-to-moderate demand levels, the proposed ﬂexible-route system tends to have the lowest system cost.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract An important but difficult combinatorial problem, in general, is to find the optimal route for a single vehicle on a given network. This paper defines a problem type, called the General Routing Problem, and gives an algorithm for its solution. The classical Traveling Salesman Problem and the Chinese Postman Problem are shown to be special limiting cases of the General Routing Problem. The algorithm provides a unified approach to both node and arc oriented routing problems, and exploits special properties of most real transportation networks such as sparsity of the associated adjacency matrix, and the tendency for arc symmetry at many nodes. For node oriented routing problems, this approach tends to produce large reduction in effective problem size.}

      \field{abstract}{The current bulk transit systems (e.g., buses) and local perishable food distribution logistics, both suffer from significant fuel inefficiency along with food wastage due to quality degradation in the distribution pipeline. In this paper we present a mechanism that exploits automated electric vehicles ({AEVs}) in future smart cities and regions to provide both people transport and fresh food distribution that minimizes empty miles of the vehicles (and thus enhances transport efficiency) while meeting the constraints on passenger transit time and food freshness. We devise an optimization framework and show how it can be solved using genetic algorithms in order to handle dynamic demands for passenger transport/products, uncertain supply delays, and variations in product availability. Performance evaluations with extensive simulations show that flexibly deciding the {AEV} routes improves the transportation efficiency by 24-78\% whereas improves the delivery quality by 2 times compared to the typical fixed routes/schedules used both by regular passenger bus services and by local distribution operations.}

      \field{abstract}{Demand-responsive transit systems are seen as a solution to improve the level of service and decrease the costs of providing transit to rural or low-demand areas. There are great expectations on the impact that driverless demand-responsive transit ({DDRT}) systems can have on a regional setting. Nevertheless, the application of {DDRT} in such type of setting has not been widely studied, in particular for scenarios where the system is an addition to the existing alternatives (as characteristic of the early diffusion stage of an innovation). This study provides an assessment of the early-stage operation of a regional {DDRT} system used by a small portion of the entire potential adopters. A methodological approach is built upon an agent-based model through which the daily operation of a {DDRT} system is simulated in detail. This approach is applied to a case study in Portugal considering scenarios varying in terms of several operational parameters, adoption rates (from 1 to 20\%), and types of services (private versus shared rides). Results show that each vehicle in the {DDRT} system with shared rides could replace up to 13 private vehicles with a decrease in the vehicle-kilometers traveled of 1\%. The {DDRT} system operation is profitable even with low adoption rates (starting from 2\% for the system with shared rides). When considering the adoption rate of 5\%, the system with shared rides is 54\% more profitable than the one with private rides, but, from the perspective of travelers, shared rides lead to longer waiting times and detours.}

      \field{abstract}{Public transport in rural and exurban areas faces major challenges, with low population densities making it difficult to provide high-quality, high-occupancy services. While demand-responsive transport is sometimes prescribed as an innovative strategy for service provision, the network planning approach to public transport suggests that integrated timed-transfer or pulse timetable networks should be explored first. This paper examines the rural network approach using examples from Switzerland, which has among the highest rates of public transport use in Western Europe, as well as nationally-coordinated Taktfahrplan scheduling that extends deep into rural areas. The basic Swiss pulse timetabling technique is reviewed, along with the application of the approach to a remote rural case study in Graubünden’s Lower Engadine and Val Müstair. Characteristics of pulse timetable networks and the wider rural network approach are considered, drawing broad lessons for their potential application elsewhere.}

      \field{abstract}{Despite emerging research on novel mobility solutions in urban areas, there have been few attempts to explore the relevance and sustainability of these solutions in rural contexts. Furthermore, existing research addressing rural mobility solutions typically focuses on a specific user group, such as local residents, second-home owners, or tourists. In this paper, we study the social inclusivity, economic viability, and environmental impacts of novel mobility solutions in rural contexts based on published scholarly literature. When doing so, we bring both permanent and temporary residents of rural areas under one research framework.}

      \field{abstract}{An investigation of the single-vehicle, many-to-many, immediate-request dial-a-ride problem is developed in two parts (I and {II}). Part I focuses on the "static" case of the problem. In this case, intermediate requests that may appear during the execution of the route are not considered. A generalized objective function is examined, the minimization of a weighted combination of the time to service all customers and of the total degree of "dissatisfaction" experienced by them while waiting for service. This dissatisfaction is assumed to be a linear function of the waiting and riding times of each customer. Vehicle capacity constraints and special priority rules are part of the problem. A Dynamic Programming approach is developed. The algorithm exhibits a computational effort which, although an exponential function of the size of the problem, is asymptotically lower than the corresponding effort of the classical Dynamic Programming algorithm applied to a Traveling Salesman Problem of the same size. Part {II} extends this approach to solving the equivalent "dynamic" case. In this case, new customer requests are automatically eligible for consideration at the time they occur. The procedure is an open-ended sequence of updates, each following every new customer request. The algorithm optimizes only over known inputs and does not anticipate future customer requests. Indefinite deferment of a customer's request is prevented by the priority rules introduced in Part I. Examples in both "static" and "dynamic" cases are presented.}

      \field{abstract}{The efforts of providing attractive transport service to residents in sparse communities have previously focused on operating ﬂexible transit services. This paper identiﬁes a new category of transit policies, called demi-ﬂexible operating policies, to ﬁll the gap between ﬂexible transit services and conventional ﬁxed-route systems. The passenger cost function is deﬁned as the performance measure of transit systems and the analytic work is performed based on a real-world ﬂag-stop transit service, in which we compare its system performance with another two comparable systems, the ﬁxed-route and ﬂex-route services, at expected and unexpected demand levels in order to be closer to reality. In addition, the dynamic-station policy is introduced to assist the ﬂex-route service to better deal with unexpectedly high demand. Experiments demonstrate the unique advantages of demi-ﬂexible operating policies in providing affordable, efﬁcient, and reliable transport service in low-demand operating environments and this work is helpful to optimize the unifying framework for designing public transit in suburban and rural areas.}

      \field{abstract}{We present {REQreate}, a tool to generate instances for on-demand transportation problems. Such problems consist of optimizing vehicle routes according to passengers’ demand for transportation under space and time restrictions (called requests). {REQreate} is flexible and can be configured to generate instances for a variety of problems types in this problem class. In this paper, we exemplify this with the Dial-a-Ride Problem ({DARP}) and On-demand Bus Routing Problem ({ODBRP}). In most of the literature, researchers either test their solution algorithms with instances based on artificial networks or they perform real-life case studies on instances derived from a specific city or region. Furthermore, locations of requests for on-demand transportation problems are mostly randomly chosen according to a uniform distribution, rather than being derived from actual data.}

      \field{abstract}{In urban settings, bus transit stands as a significant mode of public transportation, yet faces hurdles in delivering accurate and reliable arrival times. This discrepancy often culminates in delays and a decline in ridership, particularly in areas with a heavy reliance on bus transit. A prevalent challenge is the mismatch between actual bus arrival times and their scheduled counterparts, leading to disruptions in fixed schedules. Our study, utilizing New York City bus data, reveals an average delay of approximately eight minutes between scheduled and actual bus arrival times. This research introduces an innovative, {AI}-based, data-driven methodology for predicting bus arrival times at various transit points (stations), offering a collective prediction for all bus lines within large metropolitan areas. Through the deployment of a fully connected neural network, our method elevates the accuracy and efficiency of public bus transit systems. Our comprehensive evaluation encompasses over 200 bus lines and 2 million data points, showcasing an error margin of under 40 seconds for arrival time estimates. Additionally, the inference time for each data point in the validation set is recorded at below 0.006 ms, demonstrating the potential of our Neural-Net-based approach in substantially enhancing the punctuality and reliability of bus transit systems.}

      \field{abstract}{Many countries encourage their populations to use public urban transport to decrease pollution and traffic congestion. However, this can generate overcrowded routes at certain times and low economic efficiency for public urban transport companies when buses carry few passengers. This article proposes a Public Urban Transport Scheduling System ({PUTSS}) algorithm for allocating a public urban transport fleet based on the number of passengers waiting for a bus and considering the efficiency of public urban transport companies. The {PUTSS} algorithm integrates artificial intelligence ({AI}) methods to identify the number of people waiting at each station through real-time image acquisition. The technique presented is Azure Computer Vision. In a case study, the accuracy of correctly identifying the number of persons in an image was computed using the Microsoft Azure Computer Vision service. The proposed {PUTSS} algorithm also uses Google Maps Service for congestion-level identification. Employing these modern tools in the algorithm makes improving public urban transport services possible. The algorithm is integrated into a software application developed in C\#, simulating a real-world scenario involving two public urban transport vehicles. The global accuracy rate of 89.81\% demonstrates the practical applicability of the software product.}

      \field{abstract}{Urban public transportation agencies sometimes have to operate mixing vehicles of different sizes on their routes, due to resource limitations or historical reasons. Services with different passenger-carrying capacities are provided to passengers during a mixed-ﬂeet operation. A fundamental question arising here is how to optimally deploy a given ﬂeet of different bus sizes to provide services that minimize passenger waiting time. We formulate a mixed-ﬂeet vehicle dispatching problem as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming ({MINLP}) model to optimize dispatching schemes (dispatching orders and times) when a given set of buses of different sizes are available to serve demand along a route. The objective is to minimize the average passenger waiting time under time-dependent demand volumes. Stochastic travel times between stops and vehicle capacity constraints (i.e., introducing extra waiting time due to denied boarding) are explicitly modeled. A Simulated Annealing ({SA}) algorithm coupled with a Monte Carlo simulation framework is developed to solve large real-world instances in the presence of stochastic travel times. Results show that, in addition to dispatching headway, bus dispatching sequence can strongly affect waiting times under a mixed-ﬂeet operation. Indeed, with an optimal dispatching sequence, a more accurate adjustment of supply to demand is possible in accordance with time-dependent demand conditions, and the total savings in waiting time are mainly driven by a further reduction in the number of passengers left behind. The optimality of uneven dispatching headways stems from two elements: having a mixed ﬂeet and having localized peaks on demand that make buses run full.}

      \field{abstract}{In rural regions, needs-based mobility services play an important role in the provision of public services. Shared Mobility Services can optimally complement local public transportation such as buses and trains, even in rural regions, and support the transformation of transportation. There is already research on Shared Mobility Services in the literature, but there is no comparison between all of Germany-wide and a specific municipality. We were interested in learning to what extent there is acceptance among citizens and what their usage behavior is towards such new alternatives. We also aimed to find out whether there are differences between large cities and rural regions and to what extent they differ from each other. In this case study, interplay was demonstrated using the example of a funded Smart City mobility project in a German rural municipality. The objective was to show whether the potential exists to initiate traffic turnaround with the help of Shared Mobility Services. In a quantitative survey of 418 German citizens, 114 of them from the rural municipality, the acceptance and usage behavior of Shared Mobility Services (in the form of car, bike and e-scooter sharing) was investigated. The results show that participants are very interested in Shared Mobility Services and have already gained initial experience with such services. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive services; for instance, the demand for car sharing is still too low, as many citizens still own a private vehicle. Our results show that citizens are too little informed about Shared Mobility Services and that these services need to be advertised much more strongly and clearly, both in analog and digitally. Our study shows that traffic turnaround can be achieved and that many citizens can imagine greater use of Shared Mobility Services in their everyday lives in the future. However, for this to happen, the necessary infrastructure must be in place in rural regions, and local authorities must motivate citizens with sufficient educational work about what is on offer and how to use it.}

      \field{abstract}{This study investigates the preferences for the use of the urban ridepooling service {MOIA} in Hamburg, Germany. A survey with over 4,000 (non-)users was conducted and a discrete choice model was estimated to understand users’ preferences to use the service. The study provides insights into the sociodemographic characteristics of ridepooling users, their preferences towards the service and first findings on the preferences towards an intermodal combination with public transportation. The results show that factors such as travel cost, time, trip distance and purpose are significant in influencing the use of ridepooling services. According to the choice experiment, intermodal travel is a viable choice for trip distances above 10 km, primarily for public transport subscription holders. The findings of this study can inform the design and marketing of future ridepooling services, and contribute to the broader debate on the potential benefits and challenges of shared mobility services in improving urban mobility and reducing the negative impacts of transportation on the environment.}

      \field{abstract}{Disruptive developments in automated driving systems, new powertrain concepts and digital mobility are shaping changes in the way people move in rural and urban areas. In combination with these technical potentials, novel mobility concepts as for instance demand responsive transportation ({DRT}) can improve the everyday mobility of people in terms of both cost-efficiency and sustainability. Moreover, challenges related to demographic transitions and urbanisation can be addressed and negative developments mitigated. One potential application of {DRT} might be the connection of rural areas with the urban core.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper proposes and simulates an integrated autonomous vehicle ({AV}) and public transportation ({PT}) system. After discussing the attributes of and the interaction among the prospective stakeholders in the system, we identify opportunities for synergy between {AVs} and the {PT} system based on Singapore’s organizational structure and demand characteristics. Envisioning an integrated system in the context of the ﬁrst-mile problem during morning peak hours, we propose to preserve high demand bus routes while repurposing low-demand bus routes and using shared {AVs} as an alternative. An agent-based supply-side simulation is built to assess the performance of the proposed service in ﬁfty-two scenarios with diﬀerent ﬂeet sizes and ridesharing preferences. Under a set of assumptions on {AV} operation costs and dispatching algorithms, the results show that the integrated system has the potential of enhancing service quality, occupying fewer road resources, being ﬁnancially sustainable, and utilizing bus services more eﬃciently.}

      \field{abstract}{Dial-a-ride systems are attracting attention as a new style of transportation systems for urban areas. While it has been reported that such systems improve the usability of bus systems when applied in a small town or area, it is not obvious how and under what conditions the systems are effective in comparison to traditional fixed-route bus systems. We conducted two computer simulations of dial-a-ride and fixed-route systems in order to compare the usability and profitability of both systems. Simulation results indicated that: (1) The usability of the dial-a-ride system with a fixed number of buses drops very quickly when the number of requests(demands) increases. (2) When we increase the number of buses proportionally to the number of demand, the usability of the dial-a-ride system is improved more significantly than that of the fixed-route system. (3) When frequency of demands is sufficiently, the dial-a-ride system is a reasonable solution from the both usability and profitability perspectives.}

      \field{abstract}{The integrated development of city clusters has given rise to an increasing demand for intercity travel. Intercity ride-pooling service exhibits considerable potential in upgrading traditional intercity bus services by implementing demand-responsive enhancements. Nevertheless, its online operations suffer the inherent complexities due to the coupling of vehicle resource allocation among cities and pooled-ride vehicle routing. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a two-level framework designed to facilitate online fleet management. Specifically, a novel multi-agent feudal reinforcement learning model is proposed at the upper level of the framework to cooperatively assign idle vehicles to different intercity lines, while the lower level updates the routes of vehicles using an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. Numerical studies based on the realistic dataset of Xiamen and its surrounding cities in China show that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the supply and demand imbalances, and achieves significant improvement in both the average daily system profit and order fulfillment ratio.}

      \field{abstract}{Public transport lines, especially train lines, have historically played an important role as economic lifelines of rural areas. They are one of the most important factors contributing to economic prosperity as they provide access to mobility for all the inhabitants of these regions. Maintaining such rural public transport lines can be a challenge due to the low utilization inherent to rural areas. Today, with the emergence of fully self-driving cars, on-demand mobility schemes in which autonomous robotic taxis transport passengers, are becoming possible. In this work, we analyze if rural public transport lines with low utilization can be replaced with autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. More specifically, we compare the existing public transportation infrastructure to hypothetical mobility-on-demand systems both in terms of cost and service level. We perform our analysis, which focuses on the operational aspects, using a simulation approach in which unit-capacity robotic taxis are operated in a street network taking into account congestion effects and state-of-the-art control (dispatching and rebalancing) strategies. Our study considers the case of four rural train lines in Switzerland that operate at low utilization and cost coverage. We show that a unit-capacity mobility-on-demand service with selfdriving cars reduces both travel times and operational cost in three out of four cases. In one case, even a service with human driven vehicles would provide higher service levels at lower cost. The results suggest that centrally coordinated mobility-on-demand schemes could be a very attractive option for rural areas.}

      \field{abstract}{Rural regions in industrialised countries are facing problems in public transport ({PT}) provision against the backdrop of demographic change, urbanisation and austerity policies. However, innovative mobility concepts evolve under technological developments. Demand responsive transport ({DRT}) has been identified in research to meet the challenges and efficiently improve mobility through the concept of ride-pooling. Still, most of these {DRT} services are being investigated in urban settings with high mobility demand and population density. Research on low-demand regions, such as the Oberharz in Germany, is rarely considered. Moreover, the applied {DRT} services come with several restrictions regarding stop locations, customer target groups or spatial restrictions. Therefore, this paper fills this gap through spatial and temporal analysis of a real-life, fully flexible and true door-to-door {DRT} experiment. Over a 6-months period around 38,000 trips took place in the Oberharz. The analysis of these trips shows that an unrestricted {DRT} service between three main centres (Goslar, Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Osterode) results in main travel axes between these cities while the more remote areas forfeit mobility to these centres of public service provision. Consequently, a feeder-trunk system should be favoured for future {DRT} services in low-demand areas to sustainably improve mobility in remote regions. The complementary extension of the existing {PT} through such a {DRT} service should then meet mobility needs of rural areas to redeem car dependency and improve mobility for all population groups.}

      \field{abstract}{In In this study, we set out to explore how various spatial patterns of travel demand drive the effectiveness of ride-pooling services. To do so, we generate a broad range of synthetic, yet plausible demand patterns. We experiment with the number of attraction centres, the dispersion of destinations around these centres, and the trip length distribution. We apply a strategic ride-pooling algorithm across the generated demand patterns to identify shareability potential using a series of metrics related to ridepooling. Our findings indicate that, under a fixed demand level, vehicle-hour reduction due to ride-pooling can range between 18 and 59\%. These results depend on the concentration of travel destinations around the centre and the trip length distribution. Ride-pooling becomes more efficient when trips are longer and destinations are more concentrated. A shift from a monocentric to a polycentric demand pattern is found to have a limited impact on the prospects of ride-pooling.}

      \field{abstract}{We investigate the potential beneﬁts of introducing meeting points in a ride-sharing system. With meeting points, riders can be picked up and dropped off either at their origin and destination or at a meeting point that is within a certain distance from their origin or destination. The increased ﬂexibility results in additional feasible matches between drivers and riders, and allows a driver to be matched with multiple riders without increasing the number of stops the driver needs to make. We design and implement an algorithm that optimally matches drivers and riders in large-scale ride-sharing systems with meeting points. We perform an extensive simulation study to assess the beneﬁts of meeting points. The results demonstrate that meeting points can signiﬁcantly increase the number of matched participants as well as the system-wide driving distance savings in a ride-sharing system.}

      \field{abstract}{Demand-responsive connector services ({DRC}) are an important means to improve the current mobility connection problem. In this study, we develop a hybrid model for the minimization of total system cost for demand response shuttle buses, which includes operating cost and user cost, with fleet size per hour as the optimization variable of the model. The relevant variables are analyzed and numerically modeled by Matlab, and the relationship between fleet size, vehicle capacity and demand density and waiting time, onboard time, vehicle travel distance, and total system cost is analyzed. The results indicate that introducing financial subsidies markedly lowers the critical demand density necessary to ensure system viability. Moreover, subsidy intensity is positively associated with the service’s operational robustness. Through parametric examination, we observe a strictly monotonic relationship between subsidy magnitude and demand thresholds: as subsidy levels increase, the minimum demand requirements for sustainable operation decrease in a consistent, progressive manner; meanwhile, the optimal fleet size exhibits an approximately linear relationship with travel demand per unit area across varying vehicle capacities. Notably, an increase in vehicle capacity corresponds to a decrease in the growth rate of the required fleet size. This model demonstrates robust adaptability across diverse operational scenarios and serves as an effective tool for evaluating the efficiency of resource allocation in demand-responsive transit ({DRT}) services. Furthermore, it provides valuable theoretical support for the scheduling and planning of public transportation systems, particularly in low-density urban environments.}

      \field{abstract}{This study investigates the timetable design problem in areas with low-frequency public transportation services. In Japan, rural areas face sparse populations and rapid growth in the percentage of elderly people. In these areas, many bus lines offer fewer than 10 services per day. In addition to low-frequency services, it is also inconvenient to transfer to another bus or train service. Thus, there is a strong need to design a timetable that ensures smooth transfers among buses and trains. We tackle this problem by adopting existing bus lines and train timetables as much as possible to avoid drastic changes such as an increase in the number of services. Based on this approach, we present a mathematical optimization model to generate a revised bus timetable that shortens waiting time for transfers compared with the current timetable. We apply our model to a part of the Tohoku District in Japan and demonstrate its usefulness in the real world.}

      \field{abstract}{Reasonable bus timetable can reduce the operating costs of bus company and improve the quality of bus services. A data-driven method is proposed to optimize bus timetable in this study. Firstly, a bi-objective optimization model is constructed considering minimize the total waiting time of passengers and the departure times of bus company. Then, Global Positioning System ({GPS}) trajectories of buses and passenger information collected from Smart Card are fused and applied to calculate the key parameters or variables in optimization model, including time-dependent travel time, bus dwell time and passenger volume. Finally, by adopting a specific coding scheme, an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-{II} ({NSGA}-{II}) is designed to quickly search Pareto optimal solutions. Furthermore, an experiment is conducted in Beijing city from one bus line to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparing with empirical scheduling method and traditional single-objective optimization base on {GA}, the results show that the proposed model could quickly provide high-quality and reasonable timetable schemes for the administrator in urban transit system.}

      \field{abstract}{The emerging technology of autonomous vehicles has been widely recognized as a promising urban mobility solution in the future. This paper considers the integration of autonomous vehicles into bus transit systems and proposes a modeling framework to determine the optimal bus fleet size and its assignment onto multiple bus lines in a bus service network considering uncertain demand. The mixed-integer stochastic programming approach is applied to formulate the problem. We apply the sample average approximation ({SAA}) method to solve the formulated stochastic programming problem. To tackle the nonconvexity of the {SAA} problem, we first present a reformulation method that transforms the problem into a mixed-integer conic quadratic program ({MICQP}), which can be solved to its global optimal solution by using some existing solution methods. However, this {MICQP} based approach can only handle the small-size problems. For the cases with large problem size, we apply the approach of quadratic transform with linear alternating algorithm, which allows for efficient solution to large-scale instances with up to thousands of scenarios in a reasonable computational time. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of introducing autonomous buses as they are flexible to be assigned across different bus service lines, especially when demand uncertainty is more significant. The introduction of autonomous buses would enable further reduction of the required fleets and total cost. The model formulation and solution methods proposed in this study can be used to provide bus transit operators with operational guidance on including autonomous buses into bus services, especially on the autonomous and conventional bus fleets composition and allocation.}

      \field{abstract}{Low and infrequent demand in rural areas poses a problem for public transport providers to run cost-effective services and individual car use is usually the main means of transportation. We investigate how microtransit services can be integrated with existing public transport solutions (bus, train) as a flexible shared mobility alternative in rural areas and how to make them attractive alternatives to individual car use. We combine large neighborhood search with agent-based modeling and simulation to validate generated schedules for a microtransit service in terms of vulnerability to tardiness in passenger behavior or service provision. This includes the study of how disturbances, such as delays in service provision or late arrivals of passengers affect the stability of a transport schedule concerning a reliable timely delivery to transfer stops. We explore how simulation can be utilized as a means to fine-tune provider policies, e.g., how long vehicles may wait for late passengers before they depart.}

      \field{abstract}{Flexible public transport is defined as a future mobility solution that adapts to user needs and the fluctuating demand patterns that mainly appear in rural areas. However, the temporal variations in traveler preferences for flexible bus services remain largely unexplored in existing research. This constrains the realization of adaptive and customized solutions. Therefore, this study attempts to develop a distinct method for strategic planning of a flexible bus service. To this end, a combinatorial method is undertaken: quantitative social research (questionnaires) and spatial analysis. This combinatorial approach is applied at Korinth and Loutraki in Greece, two significant rural areas neighboring the Athens Metropolitan Area. The results signify that cost and time are the most crucial factors affecting the use of a flexible service. Furthermore, respondents preferred a door-to-door service in the morning and a stop-based service in the afternoon/evening. Concerning route planning, eight routes with different purposes are suggested (e.g., train feeder, touristic, etc.) covering adequately both urban and rural parts of the study area. Notably, the applied methodological approach can be a guideline for planners and policymakers, assisting them in finding effective strategies for introducing flexible public transport in rural areas, especially in contexts where collective transport culture is limited.}

      \field{abstract}{When demand for transportation is low or highly variable, traditional public bus services tend to lose their efficiency and typically frustrate (potential) passengers. In the literature, a large number of demand-responsive systems, that promise improved flexibility, have therefore been developed. At present, however, a comprehensive survey of these systems is lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a unifying framework that classifies all demand-responsive public bus systems. The classification is mainly based on three degrees of responsiveness: dynamic online, dynamic offline, and static. For each system we discuss the specific optimization problem modeled, whether realistic data is considered, and the size of the instances used for testing. Where possible, we try to draw conclusions on the current state of the literature and try to identify potential avenues for future research. Different tables are included to structure and summarize the information of all papers.}

A critical review of existing Flexible Transport Services ({FTS}) in rural areas is provided and illustrated with selected case studies, with the objective of identifying the extent to which {FTS} can enhance the public transport offer. Findings confirm that {FTS} offers considerable potential to contribute to and support the public transport system in rural areas; however, the paper also identifies the many challenges in successful development or enhancement of {FTS} in rural areas.}

The diversity of applications has motivated the study of a myriad of problem variants with different attributes. In this article, we provide a concise overview of existing and emerging problem variants. Models are typically reﬁned along three lines: considering more relevant objectives and performance metrics, integrating vehicle routing evaluations with other tactical decisions, and capturing ﬁne-grained yet essential aspects of modern supply chains. We organize the main problem attributes within this structured framework. We discuss recent research directions and pinpoint current shortcomings, recent successes, and emerging challenges.}

      \field{abstract}{Conventional public transportation ({CPT}) services in rural areas are among others confronted with the accessibility problem and low traveler quantities. Demand responsive transportation ({DRT}) is an emerging mainstream concept, which aims to offer flexible mobility services to customers and also to solve the aforementioned problems of {CPT} providers. Studies and simulations about the comparison of {CPT} and {DRT} mostly focus on urban areas. Therefore, this paper is a case study of {CPT} vs. {DRT} services in the rural town of Colditz: A stop-based and a door-to-door {DRT} service is analyzed along with a {CPT} bus line.}

      \field{abstract}{Today, driverless cars, as a new technology that allows a more accessible, dynamic and intelligent form of Shared Mobility, are expected to revolutionize urban transportation. One of the conceivable mobility services based on driverless cars is shared autonomous vehicles ({SAVs}). This service could merge cabs, carsharing, and ridesharing systems into a singular transportation mode. However, the success and competitiveness of future {SAV} services depend on their operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration and fleet specification. In addition, any change in operational models will result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of {SAV} simulation in a multimodal dynamic demand system with integrated {SAV} user taste variation, this study evaluates the performance of various {SAV} fleets and vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. Also, the impact of ridesharing and rebalancing strategies on service performance is investigated. Research results suggest that the performance of {SAV} is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing scheme proposed in this study (i.e., 20\% lower for ridesharing scenario), the standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all scenarios. The results also underline that enabling vehicle-rebalancing strategies may have an important effect on both user and servicerelated metrics. The estimated {SAV} average and maximum driven distance prove the importance of vehicle range and charging station deployment.}

      \field{abstract}{Recent developments in Mobility-on-Demand ({MoD}) systems have demonstrated the potential of road vehicles as an efficient mode of urban transportation Newly developed algorithms can compute vehicle routes in real-time for batches of requests and allow for multiple requests to share vehicles. These algorithms have primarily focused on optimally producing vehicle schedules to pick up and drop off requests. The redistribution of idle vehicles to areas of high demand, known as rebalancing, on the contrary has received little attention in the context of ride-sharing. In this paper, we present a method to rebalance idle vehicles in a ride-sharing enabled {MoD} fleet. This method consists of an algorithm to optimally partition the fleet operating area into rebalancing regions, an algorithm to determine a real-time demand estimate for every region using incoming requests, and an algorithm to optimize the assignment of idle vehicles to these rebalancing regions using an integer linear program. Evaluation with historical taxi data from Manhattan shows that we can service 99.8\% of taxi requests in Manhattan using 3000 vehicles with an average waiting time of 57.4 seconds and an average in-car delay of 13.7 seconds. Moreover, we can achieve a higher service rate using 2000 vehicles than prior work achieved with 3000. Furthermore, with a fleet of 3000 vehicles, we reduce the average travel delay by 86\%, the average waiting time by 37\%, and the amount of ignored requests by 95\% compared to earlier work at the expense of an increased distance travelled by the fleet.}

      \field{abstract}{Providing public transport in areas of low demand has long proved to be a challenge to policy makers and practitioners. With the developing economic, social and environmental trends, there is pressure for alternative solutions to the policy of subsidising conventional bus services. One potential solution is to adopt more flexible routes and/or timetables to better match the required demand. Therefore such ‘on demand’ or ‘Demand Responsive Transport’ ({DRT}) services (known as paratransit in the {US}) have been adopted in a number of locations. This paper seeks to explore the effects of area-wide factors on the demand of {DRT} by reporting the results of a statistical analysis of {DRT} service provision in the metropolitan region of Greater Manchester, the public transport authority of which offers one of the largest and most diverse range of {DRT} schemes in the {UK}. Specifically, this paper employs a multilevel modelling approach to investigate the impact of both {DRT} supply-oriented factors at the service area level and socio-economic factors at the lower super output area ({LSOA}) level on the average number of trips made by {DRT} per year. This hierarchical or ‘nested’ structure was adopted because typically the {LSOAs} within the same Service Area may share similar characteristics. It is found that the demand for {DRT} services was higher in areas with low car ownership, low population density, high proportion of white people, and high levels of social deprivation, measured in terms of income, employment, education, housing and services, health and disability, and living environment.}

      \field{abstract}{Accessibility measures how well a location is connected to surrounding opportunities. We focus on accessibility provided by Public Transit ({PT}). There is an evident inequality in the distribution of accessibility between city centers or close to main transportation corridors and suburbs. In the latter, poor {PT} service leads to a chronic car-dependency. Demand-Responsive Transit ({DRT}) is better suited for low-density areas than conventional fixed-route {PT}. {DRT} can thus reduce accessibility inequality, but this potential has not yet been exploited. On the contrary, planning {DRT} without care to inequality (as in the methods proposed so far) may further exacerbate the accessibility gap in urban areas.}

      \field{abstract}{As an emerging urban public transport mode, responsive feeder transit system is flexible and can offer door-to-door services between new districts at margins with low urban transit coverage and trunk bus station. In this study, a joint optimization of running route and scheduling for responsive feeder transit under mixed demand (i.e., reservation and real-time demands) of the time-dependent road network was investigated. A two-stage optimization method was designed together with considering the mixed demands. At the first stage, the initial running route and scheduling were determined according to all reservation demands. At the second stage, the running route and scheduling were continuously optimized based on the real-time demands. The real-time demand responsive strategy, which is built up by using quantitative batch treatment rather than immediate treatment and dynamic route updating strategy for global optimization, were designed by utilizing the submission order of real-time demands. A joint optimization model of running route and scheduling was constructed based on the quantitative batch decision points in the time-dependent road network together with combination of the actual road network. In this model, the minimum total system cost was used, which is composed of the vehicle running costs and passengers' traveling time costs with constraints including vehicle capacity, passengers' time window, and vehicle running time. A solving algorithm based on the adaptive genetic algorithm was designed by considering the characteristics of the joint optimization model.}

      \field{abstract}{Metros are usually built and added on the basis of a completed bus network in Chinese cities. After the metro construction, it is faced with the problem of how to adjust and optimize the original bus lines based on the new metro system. This research mainly proposes a bus line optimization method based on bus and metro integration. In the consideration of the geographical space, the cooperation and competition relationship between bus and metro lines is qualitatively introduced according to the geographical location and service range of metro (800 m radius) and bus (500 m radius) stations. The competition and cooperation indexes are applied to define the co-opetition relationship between bus and metro lines. The bus line optimization model is constructed based on the co-opetition coefficient and Changsha Metro Line Number 2 is chosen as a case study to verify the optimization model. The results show that the positive competition, efficient cooperation, and travel efficiency between metro and bus has been significantly enhanced after optimization. Moreover, this paper provides a reasonable reference for public transport network planning and resource allocation.}

      \field{abstract}{Autonomous vehicles ({AVs}) represent potentially disruptive and innovative changes to public transportation ({PT}) systems. However, the exact interplay between {AV} and {PT} is understudied in existing research. This paper proposes a systematic approach to the design, simulation, and evaluation of integrated autonomous vehicle and public transportation ({AV} + {PT}) systems. Two features distinguish this research from the state of the art in the literature: the first is the transitoriented {AV} operation with the purpose of supporting existing {PT} modes; the second is the explicit modeling of the interaction between demand and supply.}

      \field{abstract}{The roles of conventional (fixed-route and fixed-timetable) bus services is examined and compared to demand-responsive services, taking rural areas in England as the basis for comparison. It adopts a rural definition of settlements under a population of 10,000.Evidence from the National Travel Survey, technical press reports and academic work is brought together to examine the overall picture.Inter-urban services between towns can provide a cost-effective way of serving rural areas where smaller settlements are suitably located. The cost structures of both fixed-route and demand-responsive services indicate that staff time and cost associated with vehicle provision are the main elements. Demand-responsive services may enable larger areas to be covered, to meet planning objectives of ensuring a minimum of level of service, but experience often shows high unit cost and public expenditure per passenger trip. Economic evaluation indicates user benefits per passenger trip of similar magnitude to existing average public expenditure per trip on fixed-route services. Considerable scope exists for improvements to conventional services through better marketing and service reliability.The main issue in England is the level of funding for rural services in general, and the importance attached to serving those without access to cars in such areas.The boundary between fixed-route and demand-responsive operation may lie at relatively low population densities.The chapter uses statistical data, academic research and operator experience of enhanced conventional bus services to provide a synthesis of outcomes in rural areas.}

      \field{abstract}{Inspired by the success of private ridesourcing companies such as Uber and Lyft, transit agencies have started to consider integrating ridesourcing services (i.e. on-demand, app-driven ridesharing services) with public transit. Ridesourcing services may enhance the transit system in two major ways: replacing underutilized routes to improve operational efficiency, and providing lastmile connectivity to extend transit’s catchment area. While an integrated system of ridesourcing services and public transit is conceptually appealing, little is known regarding whether and how consumers might use a system like this and what key service attributes matter the most to them. This article investigates traveler responses to a proposed integrated transit system, named {MTransit}, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. We conducted a large-sample survey to collect both revealed preference ({RP}) and stated preference ({SP}) data and fit a {RP}-{SP} mixed logit model to examine the main determinants of commuting mode choice. The model results show that transfers and additional pickups are major deterrents for {MTransit} use. We further applied the model outputs to forecast the demand for {MTransit} under different deployment scenarios. We find that replacing low-ridership bus lines with ridesourcing services could slightly increase transit ridership while reducing operations costs. The service improvements offered by ridesourcing mainly come from reductions in wait time. Though relatively small in our study, another source of improvement is the decrease of in-vehicle travel time. Moreover, we find that when used to provide convenient last-mile connections, ridesourcing could provide a significant boost to transit. This finding verifies a popular notion among transit professionals that ridesourcing services can serve as a complement to public transit by enhancing last-mile transit access.}

      \field{abstract}{Demand-responsive transportation ({DRT}) offers a flexible solution for transportation issues in areas with insufficient public transit. Unlike fixed-route buses, {DRT} dynamically adjusts routes based on user demand. However, without effective route optimisation, {DRT} can underperform compared with fixed-route buses. This study proposes a method to reduce passenger waiting and boarding times by applying a deep Q-network ({DQN}) algorithm to establish dynamic routes for semi-dynamic {DRT} systems in urban residential areas. A simulation was conducted to compare the performance of fixed-route and dynamic-route systems, analysing how changes in passenger demand affect waiting and travel times. Results indicate that dynamic routes optimised by the {DQN} algorithm achieved higher boarding and alighting rates across all demand levels compared with fixed routes. In addition, even under high demand, dynamic-route {DRTs} reduced waiting and travel times, demonstrating superior efficiency. These findings confirm that dynamic-route {DRTs} enhance service quality and operational performance in residential areas.}

      \field{abstract}{Ridesharing revolutionizes feeder services by seamlessly connecting dispersed passengers to common destinations, such as train stations, bus terminals, airports, special event locations, and post-disaster shelters. This paper develops real-time re-optimization methodologies for generalized dynamic ridesharing feeder service operation. Such ridesharing feeder service typically encompasses a mix of scheduled and on-demand service, in which riders can schedule the request early in advance or send on-demand request for immediate service, and both types of riders are possible to share the ride. The developed methodologies enable the system to continuously re-optimize and re-adjust the vehicle routing plan that achieves the primary objective of maximizing the total number of served riders and the secondary objective of minimizing the total vehicle miles or hours traveled, simultaneously accounting for mixed types of riders' mobility requirements. This paper develops a re-optimization model implemented by a rolling horizon planning approach. An efficient heuristic algorithm, namely Large Neighborhood Search by Tabu Search algorithm ({LNS}-{TS}), is developed to solve large-scale problems. To validate the methodology, a simulation is developed to model rider activity, as well as the ridesharing process. This paper presents two case studies in Houston, Texas: a first-mile ridesharing service improving transit connectivity and a post-disaster cooling shelter access service addressing emergency transport under extreme heat. These cases represent two distinct operational contexts—everyday urban mobility and emergency disaster response—demonstrating the model's adaptability across diverse scenarios. The results generated by the re-optimization methodologies are compared with those from a periodic optimization approach, where matching and routing optimizations are conducted in isolation at different time intervals. The simulation results demonstrate that the routing plan obtained by the real-time re-optimization methodologies can serve more riders and save more vehicle miles or hours traveled compared with the periodic optimization methods. The proposed real-time, dynamic re-optimization approach for ridesharing feeder services not only demonstrates practical benefits but also holds promise for applications in autonomous vehicle systems.}

      \field{abstract}{Multimodal transportation systems are a combination of more environmentally friendly shared transport modes including public transport, ride-sharing, shuttle-sharing, or even completely carbon-free modes such as cycling to better meet customer needs. Multimodal mobility solutions are expected to contribute in mitigating traffic congestion and carbon emissions, and to result in savings in costs. They are also expected to improve access to transportation, more specifically for those in rural or low-populated communities (i.e., difficult to serve by public transportation only). Motivated by its benefits, in this study, we consider the combination of the ride-sharing and public transportation services and formulate a mixed integer programming model for the multimodal transportation planning problem. We propose a heuristic approach (i.e., angle-based clustering [{AC}] algorithm) and compare its efficiency with the exact solution for different settings. We find that the {AC} algorithm works well in both small and large settings. We further show that the multimodal transportation system with ride-sharing can yield significant benefits on travel distances and travel times.}

      \field{abstract}{The transition to alternative energy sources and the adoption of on-demand operating modes in urban bus systems are crucial steps towards reducing carbon footprints and improving public transit services. This paper presents a two-phase approach for the collaborative optimization of charging schedules and passenger services, aimed at enhancing the operation of on-demand electric bus systems. First, we propose a label-setting dynamic programming algorithm that enables the efficient generation of bus-trips for each bus line in response to passenger requests. Second, we introduce a time–space network optimization model that facilitates integrated multiple bus-trip planning for the transit network, involving multiple bus lines and charging spots. The model selects bus-trips from various time–space arcs, which represent passenger carrying, bus deployment, and bus charging activities. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a case study using real-world data from bus lines in Beijing, China. Computational results demonstrate that our approach can handle on-demand electric bus operations within minutes of solution time, efficiently serving over 2,000 passengers. Practically, our approach achieves a notable reduction in average transit time and effectively reduces the waste of public transit resources. The proposed approach can serve as a beneficial tool for decision-makers and operators seeking to enhance the performance and environmental impact of their electric bus systems.}

      \field{abstract}{In rapidly sprawling urban areas and booming intercity express rail networks, efficiently designed feeder bus systems are more essential than ever to transport passengers to and from trunk-line rail terminals. When the feeder service region is sufficiently large, the spatial heterogeneity in demand distribution must be considered. This paper develops continuum approximation models for optimizing a heterogeneous fixed-route feeder network in a rectangular service region next to a rail terminal. Our work enhances previous studies by: (i) optimizing heterogeneous stop spacings along with line spacings and headways; (ii) accounting for passenger boarding and alighting numbers on bus dwell times and patron transfer delays at the rail terminal; and (iii) examining the advantages of asymmetric coordination between trunk and feeder schedules in both service directions. To tackle the increased modeling complexity, we introduce a semi-analytical method that combines analytically derived properties of the optimal solution with an iterative search algorithm. Local transit agencies can readily utilize this approach to design a real fixed-route feeder system.}

      \field{abstract}{Flex-route transit, which combines the advantages of ﬁxed-route transit and demand-responsive transit, is one of the most promising options in low-demand areas. This paper proposes a slack arrival strategy to reduce the number of rejected passengers and idle time at checkpoints resulting from uncertain travel demand. This strategy relaxes the departure time constraints of the checkpoints that do not function as transfer stations. A system cost function that includes the vehicle operation cost and customer cost is deﬁned to measure system performance. Theoretical and simulation models are constructed to test the beneﬁts of implementing the slack arrival strategy in ﬂex-route transit under expected and unexpected demand levels. Experiments over a real-life ﬂex-route transit service show that the proposed slack arrival strategy could improve the system performance by up to 40\% with no additional operating cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can help transit operators provide more cost-eﬃcient ﬂex-route transit services in suburban and rural areas.}

      \field{abstract}{Emerging ridepooling services promise to improve existing mobility systems and increase eﬃciency in road traﬃc. Private mobility companies and policymakers strive to ﬁnd the right design of such services to meet customer needs and reduce traﬃc in urban areas. In order to analyse the eﬀects of ridepooling systems and to predict implications, the agent-based simulation framework {MATSim} oﬀers two extensions for the simulation of on-demand pooling services. Both use dynamic vehicle routing, but the interaction between service and customers on the one hand, and the pooling strategies on the other hand, diﬀer. These diﬀerences between both extensions, their characteristics and the eﬀects on service eﬃciency are pointed out here. The results show the inﬂuence of diﬀerent pooling strategies on eﬃciency, mileage, mean travel and waiting times of the system. While the {AMoD} system generally leads to better results in high-demand scenarios, the {DRT} system has advantages in low-demand scenarios due to a predictive rebalancing system based on historical demand. The {MATSim} simulations are derived from demand data of a ridepooling company in Hamburg, Germany.}

      \field{abstract}{Ride-pooling has attracted considerable attention from both academia and practitioners in recent years, promising to reduce traffic volumes and its negative impacts in urban areas. Simulation studies have shown that largescale ride-pooling has the potential to increase vehicle utilization, thereby reducing vehicle kilometers traveled ({VKT}) and required fleet sizes compared to single-passenger mobility options. However, in the real world, largescale ride-pooling services are rare and not yet widely implemented, in part due to high operating costs that are expected to decrease substantially with the advent of automated vehicles.}

      \field{abstract}{This study introduces an autonomous ride-pooling service to six communities with varying population sizes and trip densities in the Munich Metropolitan Region. We analyze a) a laissez-faire scenario without additional policies, deﬁning the modal shift through an incremental mode choice model and b) a draconian scenario in which each within-city car trip is replaced by ridepooling. Results indicate a logarithmic increase in system eﬃciency with increasing trip densities. While the results conﬁrm the potential of ride-pooling systems to reduce private car ﬂeets drastically, a reduction of traveled km is identiﬁed for scenarios with more than 1,000 requests per km2 per day.}
